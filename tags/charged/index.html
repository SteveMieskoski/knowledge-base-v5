<h2 id="Wallet"><a href="#Wallet" class="headerlink" title="Wallet"></a><strong>Wallet</strong></h2><ul>
<li>The interface / client / wrapper / holder that you use to manage your account(s).</li>
<li>Example: MyEtherWallet.com, MEWconnect, MetaMask, a hardware wallet (i.e. Ledger, Trezor, BitBox, Secalot, etc..), a Multisig Wallet Contract.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Account"><a href="#Account" class="headerlink" title="Account"></a><strong>Account</strong></h2><ul>
<li>A public &amp; private keypair that “holds” your funds.</li>
<li>Your funds are actually stored on the blockchain, not in the wallet or account.</li>
<li>Just like your Reddit account has a username (public) and password (private), so does your Ethereum account. For additional security, you can use a password to encrypt your private key which would result in a username (public) and password (private) and password for that password (private + more secure). Read more about this <a href="/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Account-Ethereum-Public-Address"><a href="#Account-Ethereum-Public-Address" class="headerlink" title="(Account / Ethereum / Public) Address"></a><strong>(Account / Ethereum / Public) Address</strong></h2><ul>
<li>You use this to send funds to an account.</li>
<li>Sometimes referred to as the “public key”</li>
<li>A string made up of 0x + 40 hexadecimal characters. (42 total characters).</li>
<li>In Ethereum, the address begins with 0x.</li>
<li>Example: <code>0x06A85356DCb5b307096726FB86A78c59D38e08ee</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Public-Key"><a href="#Public-Key" class="headerlink" title="Public Key"></a><strong>Public Key</strong></h2><ul>
<li>In cryptography, you have a keypair: the public and private key.</li>
<li>You can derive a public key from a private key, but cannot derive a private key from a public key.</li>
<li>(Advanced) In Ethereum, the address “acts” like the public key, but it’s not actually the public key.</li>
<li>(Advanced) In Ethereum, the public key is derived from the private key and is 128 hex characters. You then take the “SHA3” (Keccak-256) hash of this (64 characters), take the last 40 characters, and prefix with 0x, give you your 42-character address.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Private-Key"><a href="#Private-Key" class="headerlink" title="Private Key"></a><strong>Private Key</strong></h2><ul>
<li>You use this to access and send funds from an account.</li>
<li>The secret half of your Address / public key pairing.</li>
<li>A string of 64 hexadecimal characters.</li>
<li>(Almost) every string of 64 hexadecimal characters is a private key.</li>
<li>If you hand-type a private key differently today than yesterday, you will access a different wallet. </li>
<li><strong>Never hand-type your private key.</strong></li>
<li>This is the key you need to keep safe. Without it you cannot access your funds. Although, you don’t need to save this raw, unencrypted private key in this format. You can saving the fancy versions of it (i.e. the Keystore File / Mnemonic Phrase).</li>
<li>Example: <code>afdfd9c3d2095ef696594f6cedcae59e72dcd697e2a7521b1578140422a4f890</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Keystore-File"><a href="#Keystore-File" class="headerlink" title="Keystore File"></a><strong>Keystore File</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Encrypted version of your private key in JSON format (though it does not have a JSON extension).</li>
<li>A fancy version of your private key that is protected by a password of your choosing.</li>
<li>Safer than a private key because you need the password.</li>
<li>File name usually is in the format:<br><code>UTC + -- + DATE_CREATED + -- + YOUR_ADDRESS_WITHOUT_THE_Ox</code></li>
<li>Example of file name:<br><code>UTC--2017-07-02T20-33-09.177Z--06a85356dcb5b307096726fb86a78c59d38e08ee</code></li>
<li>Example of Contents:<br><code>{&quot;version&quot;:3,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;aa811d53-fe9a-44a2-bd1c-e737007b5591&quot;,&quot;address&quot;:&quot;06a85356dcb5b307096726fb86a78c59d38e08ee&quot;,&quot;Crypto&quot;:{&quot;ciphertext&quot;:&quot;f5a7cc8d4b8cf93510b0d0d057f3a52ac79fd48e619e0638c4ffd978ca180248&quot;,&quot;cipherparams&quot;:{&quot;iv&quot;:&quot;975ab00192e2dd74170e91ca59c0b0bd&quot;},&quot;cipher&quot;:&quot;aes-128-ctr&quot;,&quot;kdf&quot;:&quot;scrypt&quot;,&quot;kdfparams&quot;:{&quot;dklen&quot;:32,&quot;salt&quot;:&quot;0210f0d0b99e440dfbceb36373304638bac093a367ee7da6411cd165f7aa907a&quot;,&quot;n&quot;:1024,&quot;r&quot;:8,&quot;&quot;:1},&quot;mac&quot;:&quot;8197a747a3855a10546a2ff939c36470daed78e393b670efa0c12fe3b23dd7e3&quot;}}</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Mnemonic-Phrase-Recovery-Phrase"><a href="#Mnemonic-Phrase-Recovery-Phrase" class="headerlink" title="Mnemonic Phrase (Recovery Phrase)"></a><strong>Mnemonic Phrase (Recovery Phrase)</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Another fancy version of your private key, that is actually used to derive multiple private keys.</li>
<li>Usually, a 12 or 24 word phrase that allows you to access an infinite number of accounts.</li>
<li>Used by Ledger, Trezor, MEWconnect, MetaMask, Jaxx, and others.</li>
<li>Originates from BIP 39 Spec.</li>
<li>The accounts you can access with this phrase are determined by the “path”.</li>
<li>Example 12-words:<br><code>brain surround have swap horror body response double fire dumb bring hazard</code></li>
<li>Example 24-words:<br><code>card enrich gesture connect kick topple fan body blind engine lemon swarm venue praise addict agent unaware equal bean sing govern income link leg</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Hardware-Wallet"><a href="#Hardware-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Wallet"></a><strong>Hardware Wallet</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Typically, a single-purpose device that “holds” your private key(s), ensuring these keys are safe.</li>
<li>Generally, they use a 24-word phrase. This phrase you should write down on paper (not on your computer) and store separately from your hardware wallet, in multiple locations.</li>
<li>If you lose your hardware wallet, you can still gain access to your accounts &amp; funds via the word-phrase you wrote down.</li>
<li><strong>Never type the recovery phrase on your computer.</strong> It defeats the purpose of your hardware wallet.</li>
<li>See <a href="/posts/hardware-wallets/using-trezor-with-mew/">here</a> for more information about Hardware Wallets.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Address-Identicon-Address-Icon"><a href="#Address-Identicon-Address-Icon" class="headerlink" title="Address Identicon / Address Icon"></a><strong>Address Identicon / Address Icon</strong></h2><ul>
<li>The colorful blob of colors that corresponds to your address.</li>
<li>It is an easy way to see if your address is correct.</li>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/lHUrIiZ.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Example 1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/FvyLewS.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Example 2</a></li>
<li>Note: The above addresses are a single character different but have remarkably different icons &amp; colors. Even one difference in character will result in a completely separate wallet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Hexadecimal"><a href="#Hexadecimal" class="headerlink" title="Hexadecimal"></a><strong>Hexadecimal</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Used all over Ethereum for a variety of things, a hexadecimal string is comprised of the numbers <code>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</code> and <code>A B C D E F</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Seed"><a href="#Seed" class="headerlink" title="Seed"></a><strong>Seed</strong></h2><ul>
<li>The input given to derive a private key. </li>
<li>Some use this as another way of saying ‘Recovery Phrase’ or ‘Mnemonic Phrase’.</li>
<li>This should always be generated in a truly random way, not something you make up with your brain.</li>
<li>If you chose the seed, it is known as a brain wallet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Brain-Wallet"><a href="#Brain-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="Brain Wallet"></a><strong>Brain Wallet</strong></h2><ul>
<li>An account generated from a seed / password / passphrase of your choosing.</li>
<li>Humans are not capable of generating enough entropy, so the wallets derived from these phrases are insecure.</li>
<li>Brain wallets can generally be brute-forced easily by super fast computers.</li>
<li><em>Don’t use brain wallets.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Entropy"><a href="#Entropy" class="headerlink" title="Entropy"></a><strong>Entropy</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Also known as “randomness”.</li>
<li>The more random something is, the more entropy it has, and the more secure it is.</li>
<li>Usually defined in “bits of entropy”, or the number of years it would take to brute-force a ____ (i.e. private key) derived with that much entropy.</li>
<li>Ethereum private keys are 256-bit keys</li>
<li>24-Word mnemonic phrases are also 256 bits of entropy. 2048 words in the dictionary. 11 bits of entropy (the words). <code>11 * 24 = 264</code>. The last word is a checksum (read more about checksum <a href="/">here</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Derive-Derivation"><a href="#Derive-Derivation" class="headerlink" title="Derive / Derivation"></a><strong>Derive / Derivation</strong></h2><ul>
<li>To derive something is to obtain it from an original source.</li>
<li>For example, if we were to derive a Keystore from a private key and a password, this means that the Keystore is made from these two sources.</li>
<li>The Keystore is a product of the two, thus it is derived from them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Encryption"><a href="#Encryption" class="headerlink" title="Encryption"></a><strong>Encryption</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Encryption is the act of taking a string of letters/numbers, like your private key, and turning them into another string of letters/numbers through a method of private translation.</li>
<li>There are various different encryption methods.</li>
<li>Encryption offers protection against those trying to steal your information!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Encrypted-vs-Unencrypted-Keys"><a href="#Encrypted-vs-Unencrypted-Keys" class="headerlink" title="Encrypted vs Unencrypted Keys"></a><strong>Encrypted vs Unencrypted Keys</strong></h2><ul>
<li>An unencrypted private key is 64 characters long, and it is used to restore wallets.</li>
<li>An encrypted key is also 64 letters long and is a regular private key that has gone through the process of encryption, as defined above.</li>
<li>Example: If the world ‘Apple’ was your shortened private key, then it was encrypted three letters down the alphabet, your new shortened encrypted key would be ‘Dssoh’. Since you know the way to encrypt this key, you could derive the original private key from it by reversing the method of encryption.</li>
<li>Usually, encrypted private keys are kept within the extension or device they are encrypted by, and they remain out of sight from the user. This is meant to add another layer of security to keep a user’s wallet information safe.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Decentralize-Decentralization"><a href="#Decentralize-Decentralization" class="headerlink" title="Decentralize / Decentralization"></a><strong>Decentralize / Decentralization</strong></h2><ul>
<li>The process of transferring authority from a single entity (ex. Government or large corporation) to multiple smaller entities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Trustless"><a href="#Trustless" class="headerlink" title="Trustless"></a><strong>Trustless</strong></h2><ul>
<li>A distributed trustless consensus which the blockchain is responsible for.</li>
<li>Since everyone has a copy of the ledger of all transactions ever executed, there is no need for a third-party. You can verify the transactions yourself, however the Ethereum blockchain and Bitcoin blockchain were created to ensure rules and agreements between all parties are executed only when all conditions are met.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Smart-Contracts"><a href="#Smart-Contracts" class="headerlink" title="Smart Contracts"></a><strong>Smart Contracts</strong></h2><ul>
<li>A piece of code (or program) that is stored on the blockchain network.</li>
<li>Conditions of the contract are predefined by the users, if all conditions are met, certain actions are executed by the contract (program).</li>
<li>Read more about smart contracts <a href="/posts/diving-deeper/what-is-a-smart-contract/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Blockchain"><a href="#Blockchain" class="headerlink" title="Blockchain"></a><strong>Blockchain</strong></h2><ul>
<li>A decentralized, publicly-owned ledger.</li>
<li>Immutable, unable to be edited, permanent.</li>
<li>Maintained by remote miners all over the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not recommended to unlock your wallet every time you’d like to check your balance, for the security of your information. Instead, you can see all balances and transaction history through the use of an Ethereum blockchain explorer, like <a href="https://etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan</a> or <a href="https://ethplorer.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethplorer</a>. To check your balance, all you need is your public Ethereum address. This is 42 characters long and begins with an ‘0x….’.</p>
<p>Be aware that when checking ETC balances, you should use an Ethereum Classic blockchain explorer instead, such as Gastracker.io.</p>

<p>During times of normal volume, transactions are mined within seconds and do not spend any length of time in the transaction pool. There is simply not enough time to cancel or replace or override a transaction once it has been sent.</p>
<h2 id="However…"><a href="#However…" class="headerlink" title="However…"></a><strong>However…</strong></h2><p>During times of extremely high volume (like we’ve seen during the Bancor and Status Token Contribution periods), transactions could be pending for hours, if not days, before being mined.</p>
<p>During these times it is theoretically possible to replace an existing transaction with a new transaction with a higher gas price.</p>
<p>The second transaction, theoretically, will be mined before the first transaction, effectively “canceling” the first transaction.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is by sending a <code>0 ETH</code> transaction to your own address with the same nonce and higher gas price. This will “cancel” your first transaction.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee this will work, nor that it will work every time. This tool is very, very new. Please use at your own risk.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Copy and paste the transaction hash into the search field provided.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Details will appear depending on the state of the transaction. It could be…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Success:</strong> Your transaction was successfully mined and is on the blockchain. <ul>
<li>If you see a red ( ! ) symbol, or a “BAD INSTRUCTION” or “OUT OF GAS” error message, it means that the transaction was not successfully sent. You cannot cancel or replace this transaction. Instead, send a new transaction. If you received an “Out of Gas” error, you should double the gas limit you specified originally.</li>
<li>If you do not see any errors, your transaction was successfully sent. Your ETH or Tokens are where you sent them. If this balance has not been credited to your hosted wallet or exchange account 24 hours after sending, please contact that service. Send them the link to your transaction and ask them, nicely, to look into your situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Transaction Not Found:</strong> This transaction cannot be found. It’s possible that it did not go through, or that it cannot be found in the Ethereum blockchain explorer you are using. Try using the other one (Etherscan.io or Ethplorer.io). If you still can’t find it, it never went through.</li>
<li><strong>Pending:</strong> Your transaction was located in the transaction pool of the explorer you are using. It is currently pending (waiting to be mined). There is a chance you can cancel or replace this transaction, but it’s a very small chance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="“Replacing”-vs-“Canceling”-Transactions"><a href="#“Replacing”-vs-“Canceling”-Transactions" class="headerlink" title="“Replacing” vs “Canceling” Transactions"></a><strong>“Replacing” vs “Canceling” Transactions</strong></h2><ul>
<li><strong>Canceling:</strong> Generating a <code>0 ETH</code> transaction to your own address with the purpose of preventing a previous transaction from “going through” / “being mined” / being included in the blockchain.</li>
<li><strong>Replacing:</strong> Generating a <code>XX ETH</code> transaction to someon else’s address with the purpose of doing something (i.e. sending funds, revealing an ENS bid, etc.) while simultaneously not having a previous transaction go through.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason we recommend ‘Canceling’ over ‘Replacing’ is that it is not guaranteed your second transaction will actually replace your first one. Your first transaction could still be mined first, invalidating your second transaction. Choosing to replace a transaction with a new one could lead to more confusion, headaches, and pending ETH, or ETH spent unnecessarily in the form of gas. This is especially true if your first transaction is mined anyways, which is possible.</p>
<h2 id="Canceling-a-Transaction"><a href="#Canceling-a-Transaction" class="headerlink" title="Canceling a Transaction"></a><strong>Canceling a Transaction</strong></h2><p>Canceling means generating a <code>0 ETH</code> transaction to your own address with the purpose of preventing a previous transaction from “going through” / “being mined” / “being included in the blockchain” / “being stuck”.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Head to Etherscan.io or Ethplorer.io.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Paste your transaction hash.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it says pending, you can still try to cancel it.</li>
<li>If it says not found, click the button again, waiting a few minutes between each click. If that doesn’t work, it’s likely your transaction never went through.</li>
<li>If it says success, you cannot try to cancel it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> If it says pending, access the wallet you used to send the original transaction on MEW.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Send a transaction to yourself with a balance of <code>0 ETH</code>. </p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Click the ‘Send Transaction’ button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> A dialog will appear. Click the “Yes, I’m Sure” button to send.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> A new transaction hash will appear. Click the link to view it and see if you were successful. If it doesn’t show up immediately, try refreshing in a few minutes. </p>
<h2 id="Replacing-a-Transaction-Advanced-Users-Only"><a href="#Replacing-a-Transaction-Advanced-Users-Only" class="headerlink" title="Replacing a Transaction (Advanced Users Only)"></a><strong>Replacing a Transaction<br> (Advanced Users Only)</strong></h2><p>Replacing a transaction means generating a <code>XX ETH</code> transaction to someone else’s address with the purpose of doing something (i.e. sending a transaction, revealing an ENS bid, etc.) while simultaneously not having a previous transaction go through.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unlock the wallet you used to send the original transaction.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Fill the ‘To Address’ field with whatever address you wish to send to.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Change the ‘Amount’ from <code>0</code> to the amount of ETH you wish to send.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> If sending a standard ETH transaction, you can use <code>21000</code> for the gas limit. If sending tokens, raise it to around <code>100000</code>. Otherwise, just leave as is.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> For the ‘Gas Price’ field, raise this to 10 GWEI higher than your previous transaction. If this is an urgent matter, then you may choose to raise it. Keep in mind, the higher the gas price, the higher the transaction fee (Gas Limit * Gas Price).</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Check and make sure the ‘Nonce’ field is the same as your previous transaction. If it is, leave the field as is. If you change this, it will not replace the transaction you are hoping it will replace.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Click the ‘Send Transaction’ button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8.</strong> A dialog will appear. Carefully review all information displayed. Click the “Yes, I’m Sure” button to send.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9.</strong> A new transaction hash will appear. Click the link to view it and see if you were successful. If it doesn’t show up immediately, try waiting a few minutes then refreshing.</p>

<li>MEW does not receive any transaction fees. They are paid to the miners for including your transaction in a block. We are a free, open-source service.</li>
<li>The transaction pool varies from node to node. This means that a transaction may be pending in ETH (Infura.io)’s transaction pool, but not ETH (MyEtherWallet.com)’s transaction pool. For this reason, you should try all the ETH nodes we offer.</li>
<li>If possible, use the same computer / browser that you used to send the original transaction. We are working on further mitigating internal differences between our 10 nodes and their 10 transaction pools. For now, using the same computer / browser will increase the likelihood that you connect to the same transaction pool as before, if you are using the ETH (MyEtherWallet.com) node.</li>

<li>Look up your address on Etherscan.io in order to find the transaction in which you placed your bid.</li>
<li>It will be an outgoing transaction (which show as orange) to <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x6090a6e47849629b7245dfa1ca21d94cd15878ef" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ENS-Registrar</a>.</li>
<li>The transaction should have an ETH value <code>&gt;= 0.01 ETH</code> (not one that says <code>0 ETH</code>).</li>

<li>Check the amount that you sent with your bid (the amount shown that you sent in your transaction from Step 1).</li>
<li>Look through your transaction history or any information you have saved for other auctions, and try using those values at the amount you bid.</li>
<li>Check again to make sure that you definitely sent from the address you entered.</li>

<p>MyEtherWallet, at the time of this writing, rate-limits at 400 requests per minute (or about 6 requests per second). This is in order to prevent DDOS’s like we have seen before, or people using our nodes to excess and making us pay an even larger bill.</p>
<p>Our goal is to allow individuals to interact with Ethereum, not provide uber-robust infrastructure for all your heart’s desires. This should be more than enough for a single person’s use, but feel free to reach out to us about why you need more, and we can adjust.</p>
<p>If you are going to be using it more than 400 req per minute on average, or just want to ensure uptime, we strongly recommend you get your own node.</p>
<p>Our backend infrastructure is on AWS and is open-source via Docker + CloudFormation walkthrough. You can actually do it yourself and run your own public or private node via <a href="https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/docker-geth-lb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these instructions</a>. </p>
<p>Or you could pay a small fee and use <a href="https://quiknode.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuikNode</a>, which makes it even easier.</p>
<p>For both of these options, you could connect to your new node via the ‘Add Custom Node’ option in the network selector in the top-right corner. Further details on how to connect to your own node can be found <a href>here</a>, or you could connect directly via API.</p>

<p>There is no minimum to transfer out of MyEtherWallet (MEW). We are not an exchange and have no way of blocking your withdrawals or deposits.</p>
<p>The only ‘minimum’ requirement is the minimum amount of gas needed to complete the transaction. For a standard transaction, that is <code>0.000441 ETH</code>.</p>
<p>If you have <code>0.000X ETH</code> in your account and want to empty your account completely, send <code>0.01 ETH</code> into the account and use the “Send Entire Balance” button to send the entire balance out. This will leave you with a balance of <code>0 ETH</code>.</p>

<p>We also offer support for ETC, Testnet ETH, UBQ, EXP, POA, TOMO, ELLA, ETSC, EGEM, CLO, GO, EOSC, AKA, ESN, PIRL, ETHO, ATH, ILT, WEB, and MUSICOIN. These can be easily accessed through our Network/Node list, after accessing your wallet. </p>
<p>You can use our swap function to swap between BTC and ETH, thanks to our partner Bity, but we do not offer support for BTC. We just offer the option to swap it. This requires you have a BTC wallet, to receive the funds. </p>

<p>The Ethereum Name Service, also known as ENS, is a domain service that uses a bidding system to assign a specific domain tied to your wallet’s account address. The process involves anonymously bidding on a unique name, waiting three days, then revealing your bid. The highest bidder gains ownership of this ENS domain, to use it however they wish.</p>
<p>ENS domains take the format of <code>YourDomainHere.eth</code>. The intention behind this is to simplify the normal public address into a form that is easier to use and send to others. There are other use cases as well, but this is the main reason for this service as of right now.</p>
<p>An easy example of this is our MEW donation address:</p>
<p>Normal donation address: <code>0xDECAF9CD2367cdbb726E904cD6397eDFcAe6068D</code></p>
<p>ENS donation address: <code>mewtopia.eth</code></p>
<p>Both of these addresses lead to the same wallet destination, but the ENS domain is much more convenient.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Reserve-an-ENS-Domain"><a href="#How-to-Reserve-an-ENS-Domain" class="headerlink" title="How to Reserve an ENS Domain"></a><strong>How to Reserve an ENS Domain</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Head to MyEtherWallet.com.</p>
<ul>
<li>Always check the URL to make sure you’re on our legit site!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Access your wallet. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t already have a wallet, you will need to <a href="/posts/Getting_Started/How_To_Create_A_Wallet/">create a new wallet</a>. </li>
<li>You will also need a small amount of ETH for <a href="/">gas</a>. We generally recommend <code>.01 ETH</code> for 1 - 2 transactions. Starting and finalizing ENS auctions both count as a transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Head to the Dapps section, to the left of your wallet’s overview page (or by clicking the ‘Change’ function at the top right). </p>
<ul>
<li>Here you will see the ‘Register ENS’ option. Click there!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Enter your desired domain name to see if it is available.</p>
<ul>
<li>ENS domains must be 7 characters or longer.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that the final product will look like <code>YourDomainHere.eth</code>.</li>
<li>You can also search Etherscan.io for available ENS domains.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Once you’ve chosen your desired ENS name, it’s time to start an auction. Get out a pen and paper, you’ll need to write some information down.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Enter your actual bid amount and a bid mask amount. A secret phrase will be generated at random below these fields.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your actual bid amount is the amount you’re willing to actually lock up and bid for this domain. </li>
<li>Your bid mask must be at least the amount of your actual bid value. This is made as a disguise to deter other bidders who may be looking to scoop up cheap domain names.</li>
<li>If multiple people bid on this domain, the highest bidder will only have to lock up the amount of ETH made by the the second highest bidder. </li>
<li>If no one else is planning on bidding (which is usually the case), you can get the domain for as little as <code>.01 ETH</code>!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Write down your actual bid, bid mask, and secret phrase. </p>
<ul>
<li>This information is necessary for you to finalize your auction and ENS domain. </li>
<li>Your secret phrase is extremely important, as it must be used with your actual bid amount to finalize the domain auction. If you’re missing even one letter, the process will not be completed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 8.</strong> On the next screen, review all your information and confirm it. </p>
<ul>
<li>Write it all down! Print it out! Remember this. You’ll need it in three days.</li>
<li>Make sure to note the time the auction ends. Check the timezone as well, so there is no confusion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 9.</strong> On the last day of the auction, return to the ENS section of our interface and search for your domain to reveal your bid within the time limit. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you end up losing the auction, 99.5% of your bid will be refunded to you, with the exception of 0.5% which will be burned.</li>
<li>If you do not reveal your bid in time, your actual bid amount will be permanently lost. If there were no other bidders, you may be able to <a href="/">re-open the bid</a> with no additional costs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 10.</strong> If you won, MEW will give you the option to finalize your domain name.<br>*This will only set your address as the owner of the domain, but you’re not done yet. If you want this domain to point to your address for sending, you still have a bit to do. Check out <a href="/">this guide</a> for more information on how to achieve this final step.</p>

<p>If you’re missing funds, you should first confirm that the transaction was broadcast successfully. If you have your transaction hash, plug it into the search bar at <a href="https://etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan.io</a>.</p>
<p>A successful transaction will look like <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xcde5a30a1a1514919e9c357d4e89211701aa22a741936ad9516c2987d8b097c9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>.</p>

<p>The lack of any red symbols or errors means that your transaction was successful! You can click on the ‘To:’ address on this transaction overview to redirect yourself to the funds destination. Make sure you double check the address to confirm it was 100% the same address you meant to send to. Even one wrong character will mean your funds were sent to another wallet’s address.</p>
<p>If you see an error on your transaction, this means it was not successful, and your funds never left their original wallet. You will need to try sending the transaction again, making a few changes to help it broadcast successfully. Depending on the error shown, it’s usually an easy fix. </p>

<p>The first thing to understand is that MyEtherWallet (MEW) does not ‘create’ any private keys or public addresses. MEW (and other ETH wallet services) randomly generate private key/public address pairings for a user when ‘creating a new wallet’. </p>
<p>Every ETH address begins with ‘0x’ and is followed by 40 hexadecimal characters, for a total of 42 characters. Hexadecimal characters can be any character between the ranges of ‘a - f’ and ‘0 - 9’.  This means there are <code>16^40</code> possible ETH addresses, which is the same as <code>2^160</code> possible addresses. </p>
<p>That means there are <code>1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976</code> possible addresses to choose from. </p>
<p>Keys are not ‘picked’, though. The reason randomizing this process is so crucial is because our brains are flawed. We are not capable of achieving true randomization with our choices. If you choose your own private key, you will have access to a wallet of your choice. However, if someone else also picks that private key, all of your information and funds will be at their mercy. So we let technology generate these addresses for us, for true entropic generation.</p>
<p>To put all of this in perspective, there are approximately <code>7.5 x 10^18</code> grains of sand on Earth. That’s</p>
<p><code>7,500,000,000,000,000,000</code> grains of sand</p>
<p>compared to</p>
<p><code>1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976</code> addresses</p>
<p>That’s quite a difference. In fact, this number is so mind-blowingly big that, at one address per second, it would still take longer than the galaxy has existed (~13.21 billion years) to even make a tiny dent – and you would still be unlikely to run across an address with any activity on it! Not only that, but it would take more energy than the Sun can offer to even try and brute-force any specific address.  </p>
<p>The estimated age of the Universe itself is <code>~4.32 x 10^17</code> seconds old. In order to use up even half of the possible addresses in that amount of time, you would need to generate around <code>1.6 x 10^31</code> addresses every second. That’s 16 nonillion addresses every second, since the dawn of the Universe. And that’s just to use up half of them!</p>
<p>Even if the blockchain is vigorously active for the next ten thousand years, the chances of receiving a duplicate address are basically zero.</p>

<p>Every Ethereum address has two versions to it, one that includes uppercase letters and one that doesn’t. These are called the checksummed and non-checksummed versions, respectively. Take for example, the MEW donation address:</p>
<p>Non-checksummed version: <code>0xdecaf9cd2367cdbb726e904cd6397edfcae6068d</code></p>
<p>Checksummed version: <code>0xDECAF9CD2367cdbb726E904cD6397eDFcAe6068D</code></p>
<p>These two addresses include all the same characters and lead to the same destination, the checksummed one is just a little more useful for determining the accuracy of the address. Both versions of the address are viable and usable, but the checksummed version is the preferred version to use. If even one character of an address is off, any tokens or coins sent to the wrong address will be lost forever. This is not something to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will receive an error warning you that your address is not checksummed, preventing or warning you from making a transaction or adding a custom token. This is for your own safety. Do not be alarmed, though! </p>

<p>Each transaction (including token and contract transactions) require gas and that gas is paid in Ether. You can think of this like a transaction fee. The more computational effort a transaction takes, the more gas you need.</p>
<p>MyEtherWallet estimates how much gas you will need - but sometimes it doesn’t get it right.</p>
<h2 id="Solution-Try-manually-increasing-the-“Gas-limit”-by-doubling-it"><a href="#Solution-Try-manually-increasing-the-“Gas-limit”-by-doubling-it" class="headerlink" title="Solution: Try manually increasing the “Gas limit” by doubling it."></a><strong>Solution: Try manually increasing the “Gas limit” by doubling it.</strong></h2><p>Any excess gas will be returned to you, so you could even triple or quadruple it.</p>
<p>We are always trying to improve how we estimate gas as contracts become more complex. However, sometimes we still get it wrong. Manually increasing gas limits and price can dramatically change how quickly and stable your transactions are verified.</p>
<h2 id="More-Information-About-Gas"><a href="#More-Information-About-Gas" class="headerlink" title="More Information About Gas"></a><strong>More Information About Gas</strong></h2><ul>
<li>A standard TX will be <code>21000</code> gas &amp; a gas price of <code>0.00000002 ETH</code> so the total TX fee will be <code>0.00042 ETH</code>.</li>
<li>With tokens, the amount of gas is typically 50000 gas - 100000 gas, so the total TX fee increases to <code>0.001 ETH - 0.002 ETH</code>.</li>
<li>The amount of ETH or tokens you are sending does not affect the amount of gas you need.</li>
<li><strong>Gas <em>limit</em></strong> is the maximum amount of gas you will send with your transaction. This is in units of gas.</li>
<li><strong>Gas <em>price</em></strong>, which you will not see except on the Offline page, is how much each unit of gas costs. We set it at <code>0.00000002 ETH</code>.</li>

<p>A ‘Token Already Exists’ error can occur when an incorrect contract address was added as a custom token. </p>
<p>To find the correct contract address, follow these instructions:</p>

<p>Using our above example, instead of ‘SNT’, you would add the token as ‘SNT2’.</p>
<p>This has no actual effect on the token itself, but is just a placeholder to make organizing your tokens easier.</p>

<p>If you are getting an error message saying ‘Window Blocked’ when using a Trezor, Ledger, or MetaMask to confirm a transaction, this is because you are blocking pop-ups with the browser. </p>
<p>To fix this issue, you will need to ‘Allow Pop-Ups’ for MyEtherWallet.com.</p>
<p>This allows information to safely be sent to your device/extension so that the transaction can be signed and safely sent via our infrastructure.</p>

<p>MyEtherWallet (MEW) offers a variety of ways to access one’s Ethereum wallet, by selecting the ‘Access My Wallet’ option on the front page.</p>
<p>They are, from most to least recommended:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware Wallets (<a href="/">Ledger Nano S</a>, <a href="/">Trezor</a>, <a href="/">Digital Bitbox</a>, <a href="/">Secalot</a>, etc.)</li>
<li>MEWconnect</li>
<li>MetaMask</li>
<li>Keystore/JSON File + Password</li>
<li>Mnemonic Phrase + Password</li>
<li>Private Key</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Hardware-Wallets"><a href="#Hardware-Wallets" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Wallets"></a><strong>Hardware Wallets</strong></h2><p>Hardware wallets use the highest security measures to encrypt a private key within the device itself, keeping phishers and hackers at bay. Users of most hardwares wallets do not receive their private key, but instead receive a 24-word mnemonic phrase for recovery purposes. The devices are also usually accompanied by a pin code or password used to unlock the device, and all information about each wallet is kept on the actual physical device itself. </p>
<p>To learn more about accessing MEW with hardware wallets, reference our <a href="/posts/migration/moving-from-exchange-to-mew/">Migrating to/from MEW</a> category.</p>
<h2 id="MEWconnect"><a href="#MEWconnect" class="headerlink" title="MEWconnect"></a><strong>MEWconnect</strong></h2><p>This is our free MEW companion app for iOS and Android smartphones. We call it a ‘hardware wallet without all the hardware’. When creating a wallet with MEWconnect, your private key is kept encrypted on a secure, local vault in your phone. For backup, you are given a mnemonic phrase (much like the hardware wallets above). The wallet is also accompanied by a password, which is used to unlock it on your device.</p>
<p>To learn more about accessing MEW with MEWconnect, reference our <a href="/posts/mewconnect/mewconnect-101-create/">MEWconnect User Guide</a>. </p>
<h2 id="MetaMask"><a href="#MetaMask" class="headerlink" title="MetaMask"></a><strong>MetaMask</strong></h2><p>This is a Chrome Extension that allows the creation of an ethereum-based wallet that keeps one’s private key encrypted within the extension itself. It also generates a 12-word mnemonic phrase for recovery purposes. MetaMask allows users to name their separate wallets, see funds within the extension, and offers the option to import the private key information of a previously created wallet, if desired. </p>
<h2 id="To-connect-MEW-with-MetaMask"><a href="#To-connect-MEW-with-MetaMask" class="headerlink" title="To connect MEW with MetaMask:"></a><strong>To connect MEW with MetaMask:</strong></h2><h4 id="This-assumes-you-already-have-a-MetaMask-wallet"><a href="#This-assumes-you-already-have-a-MetaMask-wallet" class="headerlink" title="This assumes you already have a MetaMask wallet."></a><strong>This assumes you already have a MetaMask wallet.</strong></h4><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Login to your MetaMask wallet via their Chrome Extension.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On the MEW front page, select ‘Access My Wallet’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Select the ‘MetaMask’ option to connect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Read and accept the ‘Terms and Conditions’, then select ‘Access My Wallet’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Confirm connection in the MetaMask pop-up window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> You’re done!</p>
<h2 id="Keystore-JSON-Password"><a href="#Keystore-JSON-Password" class="headerlink" title="Keystore/JSON + Password"></a><strong>Keystore/JSON + Password</strong></h2><p>The Keystore/JSON is a file that holds an encrypted version of one’s private key. This key is encrypted with a chosen password by the user. As such, it is impossible to change the password for these files. The only way to change the password is to make a completely new Keystore file, which can be achieved in our MEW Chrome Extension with one’s private key. Keystore files should not be opened. They are only to be utilized when accessing the Keystore/JSON option on our site and when prompted for one’s ‘JSON file’. You can read more about the functionality of a Keystore/JSON file <a href="/posts/security-and-privacy/what-is-a-keystore-file/">here</a>.</p>

We highly suggest [using MEW offline][usingOffline] for this option."></a><strong>This is not a recommended way to connect. We highly suggest [using MEW offline][usingOffline] for this option.</strong></h4><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> On the MEW front page, select ‘Access My Wallet’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Choose the ‘Software’ option to connect, then select ‘JSON File’ and click ‘Continue’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Locate your Keystore/JSON file in the pop-up window. It should begin with ‘UTC–’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Enter your password, and click ‘Unlock wallet’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> You’re done!</p>
<h2 id="Mnemonic-Phrase-Password"><a href="#Mnemonic-Phrase-Password" class="headerlink" title="Mnemonic Phrase (+ Password)"></a><strong>Mnemonic Phrase (+ Password)</strong></h2><p>This is a list of 12 to 24 words that are generated and given to users upon certain forms of wallet creation (i.e. MEWconnect, MetaMask, Hardware Wallets, JAXX wallets, etc.). Sometimes these phrases have passwords associated with them, and sometimes they do not. The order and spelling of the words in a mnemonic phrase is directly tied to one’s private key, and therefore is not recommended as a regular way to access a wallet. It is best to only use this phrase for recovery purposes.</p>
<h2 id="To-connect-with-Mnemonic-Phrase-Password"><a href="#To-connect-with-Mnemonic-Phrase-Password" class="headerlink" title="To connect with Mnemonic Phrase (+ Password):"></a><strong>To connect with Mnemonic Phrase (+ Password):</strong></h2><h4 id="This-is-not-a-recommended-way-to-connect-We-highly-suggest-using-MEW-offline-for-this-option"><a href="#This-is-not-a-recommended-way-to-connect-We-highly-suggest-using-MEW-offline-for-this-option" class="headerlink" title="This is not a recommended way to connect. We highly suggest using MEW offline for this option."></a><strong>This is not a recommended way to connect. We highly suggest <a href="/posts/offline/offline-mew-looks-weird/">using MEW offline</a> for this option.</strong></h4><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> On the MEW front page, select ‘Access My Wallet’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Choose the ‘Software’ option to connect, then select ‘Mnemonic Phrase’ and click ‘Continue’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Choose whether it was a 12 or 24 word phrase, then fill out the form. </p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Enter your password (leave this blank if you’re using a MEWconnect phrase), and click ‘Unlock wallet’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Choose your wallet’s address amongst the list generated, and you’re done!</p>
<h2 id="Private-Key"><a href="#Private-Key" class="headerlink" title="Private Key"></a><strong>Private Key</strong></h2><p>The private key is a string of 64 characters tied permanently to a public address. This is sometimes given to users when wallets are created and sometimes kept encrypted (in the case of MEWconnect, MetaMask, and Hardware Wallets). <em>Using one’s private key should always be a last-ditch effort of access, only to be utilized when all else fails.</em> This should not be the main method of entry for anyone to access their wallets. Private keys are the number one most sensitive information anyone can have for a wallet, because private keys allow immediate access and can never be changed. Therefore, it is extremely important to keep this safe, secure, and secret.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Copy and paste your private key into the value field. </p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click ‘Unlock Wallet’ and you’re done!</p>

<p>Any ERC20 token can be added to your local MEW interface by following these instructions.</p>
<h2 id="Make-sure-it-isn’t-already-a-default-token"><a href="#Make-sure-it-isn’t-already-a-default-token" class="headerlink" title="Make sure it isn’t already a default token"></a><strong>Make sure it isn’t already a default token</strong></h2><p>First you’ll want to make sure your token isn’t already listed in our interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> <a href>Access your wallet</a>. </p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom1.png" width="85%"></p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Search our default token list for the token you are looking for.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you see the token, but don’t see a balance, it’s possible our default listing is for a token with the same symbol but a different contract address. In this case, continue with these steps as if you didn’t see it in the list.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> If you don’t see your token, continue with this article.</p>
<h2 id="Looking-for-the-token’s-information"><a href="#Looking-for-the-token’s-information" class="headerlink" title="Looking for the token’s information"></a><strong>Looking for the token’s information</strong></h2><p>You will need three pieces of information to add a custom token with our interface: the contract address, decimal count, and symbol. All of this information can be found via an Ethereum blockchain explorer, like Etherscan.io or Ethplorer.io. We will show how to find this via Etherscan.io.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Head to <a href="https://etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan</a>. </p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom2.png" width="85%"></p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> If you have a balance of the token you are trying to add, search for your public address (0x…) in the search bar. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you do not have a balance and would like to add the token before receiving it, search for the token in the search bar. Make sure you find the correct token, or you will be adding another token to your list.</li>
<li>There is no harm in sending your ERC20 token to your address before adding it as a custom token. In fact, this may make it easier to find via etherscan.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom3.png" width="60%"></p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Find your token in the token balances dropdown. Select the token to be taken to a token information screen. </p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom4.png" width="85%"></p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Here, you will find the token’s contract address and decimal count to the right of the interface. Remember the decimal count, and click on the contract address to be taken to the token’s main screen.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom5.png" width="70%"></p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Copy this address to your clipboard, and head back to MEW. At the top of the token list, click ‘+ Custom Tokens’ to bring up the custom token addition screen. </p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom6.png" width="50%"></p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Paste the contract address into the top field, input the token’s symbol (abbreviation) into the second field, and enter the decimal count last. Then click ‘Save’. You’re done!</p>
<h2 id="Common-Issues"><a href="#Common-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Common Issues"></a><strong>Common Issues</strong></h2><h4 id="“Token-Already-Exists-”"><a href="#“Token-Already-Exists-”" class="headerlink" title="“Token Already Exists!”"></a><em>“Token Already Exists!”</em></h4><p><img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom7.png" width="50%"></p>
<p>If you see this error, there is a simple fix for it. Re-enter your custom token information, but put a ‘2’ after the symbol. I.e. If the token’s symbol is ‘XYZ’, enter is as ‘XYZ2’.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom8.png" width="50%"></p>
<p>If you still get this error after submitting it with the modified symbol, then your token is likely already a default token. Try searching the token list again for the symbol. If you see it with a balance of 0, but etherscan.io shows a balance, then you’ll likely need to change networks to another ETH node, in the upper right-hand corner. </p>
<h2 id="My-custom-tokens-are-disappearing"><a href="#My-custom-tokens-are-disappearing" class="headerlink" title="My custom tokens are disappearing!"></a><strong>My custom tokens are disappearing!</strong></h2><p>If your custom tokens are disappearing every time you access our interface, make sure that you do not have a cache-clearing software installed (i.e. CCleaner). Your custom token information is stored locally in your browser, so this software will clear this information and require you to re-submit the token every time you access your wallet. </p>
<h2 id="I’d-like-it-to-be-a-default-token"><a href="#I’d-like-it-to-be-a-default-token" class="headerlink" title="I’d like it to be a default token!"></a><strong>I’d like it to be a default token!</strong></h2><p>We are always happy to support new tokens in our default list.

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On your wallet’s overview page, you will see a ‘Network’ section in the upper right hand corner. Click the icon that says ‘Open networks’ when hovered over.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Choose the network you would like to interact with from this list. Your address will not change, but your funds will depending on the network chosen. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you see multiple networks for your choice (i.e. ETC), there is no need to overthink it. Just choose whichever one you’d like, and change it to another if it seems slow or congested! </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Using-a-Hardware-Wallet"><a href="#Using-a-Hardware-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="Using a Hardware Wallet"></a><strong>Using a Hardware Wallet</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Access your wallet using the ‘Hardware’ option. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Choose the network you would like to connect to, followed by the derivation path desired.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will notice there are separate derivation paths for ETC and ETH. You do not have to change to the ETC path in order to access your ETC. Changing the derivation path will produce a different list of Ethereum addresses than you may be used to seeing. Simply change the network to ETC, and feel free to access your familiar ETH address through the ETH derivation path. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Connect with your device, and you’re done! You will be directed to your wallet’s overview page on the desired network.</p>

<p>To change your password on MEWconnect, all you need is your phone and your 24-word recovery phrase. </p>
<p>If you still remember your password and do not have your 24-word recovery phrase, please read this article on <a href>how to backup your wallet</a> (found in section 2). Resetting your wallet without knowing your recovery phrase will result in the permanent loss of your wallet.</p>
<p>If you do not remember your password and do not have your 24-word recovery phrase, there is nothing we can do. Retrace your steps and try to remember your password, or your wallet will be lost forever. </p>
<h2 id="Change-Your-Password"><a href="#Change-Your-Password" class="headerlink" title="Change Your Password"></a><strong>Change Your Password</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Reset your wallet, either on the login screen or under our ‘Info’ section. </p>
<ul>
<li>Choose ‘Forgot password?’ on the home screen, or ‘Reset wallet &gt;’ in the Info tab.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/posts/mewconnect/ForgotPassMC.jpg" width="35%"><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Enter your 24-word recovery phrase. Make sure each word is in the correct order and spelled accurately. </p>
<ul>
<li>Do not include commas between the words, only a single space.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Enter a new password. Please choose a difficult one, for increased security. </p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to write this password down somewhere, so you don’t forget it! </li>
<li>We cannot recover or change your password for you.</li>
</ul>

<p>MyEtherWallet (MEW) offers three ways to create a new ETH wallet. </p>
<p>Out of the three, we highly suggest creating your wallet with our smartphone app, MEWconnect. This is the best option for the security and safekeeping of your information. To learn more about creating your wallet with MEWconnect, click <a href="/posts/mewconnect/mewconnect-101-create/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The other two options we offer are by Keystore/JSON file and Mnemonic Phrase.<br><em>These are <strong>not</strong> recommended ways to create and access your wallet.</em></p>
<p>The following information is for those who wish to proceed, regardless of our warnings. If you’re going to do something, learn to do it safely. We highly suggest you <a href="/posts/offline/offline-mew-looks-weird/">access MEW offline</a> when using these options.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Access your wallet and head to the ‘Contracts’ section, to the left of your wallet interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> There should be a Must Multisig Contract ABI in the dropdown. If not, we have provided the ABI at the bottom of this article, which you can manually input into the interface. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Enter your contract address in the ‘Contract Address’ field at the top. </p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Select ‘Execute’ from the dropdown menu. </p>
<ul>
<li>Enter the address you want to send to in the <code>_To</code> field.</li>
<li>Enter the amount you want to send in the <code>_Value</code> field. </li>
<li>Leave the <code>Data</code> field empty. </li>
<li>We suggest sending a small amount first, to test the waters.</li>
<li>Unlock the owner’s address, and click <code>Write</code>.</li>
<li>A pop-up will appear. Leave the <code>Amount to Send</code> as <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>Click ‘Generate Transaction’, confirm the transaction, and send. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Click the Transaction ID that outputs with the ‘Success’ message. Copy this ID.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> If it’s a multisig contract with two owners, you will need to refresh this page and choose ‘Confirm’.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Step 5, you opened the Transaction ID from the ‘Execute’ call. You should have a page like <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0c643a1ae66637217f24791df05071c7849941a1231cf9fa2a0daf145da833e3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> open.</li>
<li>Click the ‘Event Logs’ tab.</li>
<li>For reference, at <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x47e4cc8748e296d9b5d85ebd9bd705177bb1940517b084a2efcca11feeb2391d#eventlog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> link (note this is not YOUR link, it’s an example), the <code>_h</code> value would be <code>9228aeaf3ed560274899483646ea4ce9b322bccffac60cac2d035d08752617f4</code>.</li>
<li>Check the link above where it says that string, and then compare it to find what YOUR <code>_h</code> value is. It will be different than what we provided as an example. </li>
<li>Go back to MEW, where you have the ‘Confirm’ page open, and paste your string into the <code>_h</code> field.</li>
<li>Click ‘Write’ again and unlock the second owner’s account. </li>
<li>Generate and send the transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Double-check to confirm everything went as intended.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8.</strong> If your multisig is a 3 of 5 multisig, you will repeat the confirm process outlined in Step 6 until it reaches the necessary approvals. Luckily, the <code>_h</code> value will remain the same for each of them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9.</strong> You can view another approval for our previous example <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x47e4cc8748e296d9b5d85ebd9bd705177bb1940517b084a2efcca11feeb2391d#eventlog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10.</strong> Feel free to repeat this process whenever you want to send ETH. </p>

<p>MyEtherWallet (MEW) makes it easy for you to send a transaction. All you need is a wallet, the Ethereum address you’d like to send funds to, and a little ETH for gas. </p>
<p>If you plan to move large amounts of ETH or ERC20 tokens, we suggest sending a small amount first to make sure everything goes as planned. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> <a href>Access your wallet</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Your wallet should automatically be opened on the ‘Send Transaction’ screen. If it’s not, you can find this area to the left of your wallet overview page.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Fill in the type of currency you’d like to send, the amount, and the address you’d like to send to. </p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to double and triple check the address you’re sending to! We cannot recover funds sent to the wrong address.</li>
<li>When sending your entire balance of ETH, choose the ‘Send Entire Balance’ option, so your gas is auto-calculated out of the total. </li>
<li>Gas and gas limit will auto-generate based on network congestion.</li>
<li>If you don’t see the token you’d like to send, you may need to <a href>add it as a custom token</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click ‘Send Transaction’ and confirm the transaction on the next screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re using MEWconnect or a hardware wallet, be sure to confirm the transaction on your device as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Your transaction has been posted! Copy your transaction hash, for your records. </p>
<ul>
<li>Check your transaction hash on <a href="https://etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan</a> to make sure everything went through properly. </li>
</ul>

<p>These random V2 JSON files always make things complex. We apologize in advance.</p>
<p>You need to convert it to the standard V3 (‘Keystore / UTC’) file. The easiest way is using geth.</p>
<p>Download <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the appropriate version of the geth</a> based on your operating system.</p>
<p>Once you download it, extract the zip. Also copy your V2 JSON file into the same folder.</p>
<p>There are really explicit instructions for PC and Mac users <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/465/How To-import-a-plain-private-key-into-geth-or-mist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now you have to open a command line window and type in the following command:</p>
<p><code>geth account import nameofyourwalletfile</code></p>
<p>This will import your file into geth and convert it to the latest (V3) keystore file. </p>

<li>Mac: <code>~/Library/Ethereum</code></li>
<li>Linux: <code>~/.ethereum</code></li>
<li>Windows: <code>%APPDATA%\Ethereum</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Copy that file, and select it on <a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MEW</a>, and you’re good to go!</p>
<p>Moving foward, use this file. Keep a backup of it (and the old file, just in case).</p>

<p>If you are getting the error that looks like this: <code>Insufficient funds. Account you try to send transaction from does not have enough funds. Required XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and got: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</code>, it means you do not have enough ETH in your account to cover the cost of gas.</p>
<p>Each transaction (including token and contract transactions) requires gas, and that gas is paid in ETH. You can think of this like a transaction fee.</p>
<h2 id="Solution-Send-0-01-ETH-to-that-account-in-order-to-be-able-to-make-the-transaction"><a href="#Solution-Send-0-01-ETH-to-that-account-in-order-to-be-able-to-make-the-transaction" class="headerlink" title="Solution: Send 0.01 ETH to that account in order to be able to make the transaction."></a><strong>Solution: Send 0.01 ETH to that account in order to be able to make the transaction.</strong></h2><p>A standard transaction will take a gas limit of <code>21000</code> and a gas price of <code>0.00000002 ETH</code>, which makes the total transaction fee <code>0.00042 ETH</code>. With tokens, the amount of gas is typically <code>50000 gas - 100000 gas</code>, so the total TX fee increases to <code>0.001 ETH - 0.002 ETH</code>.</p>
<p>The number displayed in that error message is the amount required to cover the cost of the transaction in Wei. Take that number, divide by <code>1000000000000000000</code>. This will give you the amount of Ether you need to send to that account to make the transaction.</p>
<h2 id="More-Information-About-Gas"><a href="#More-Information-About-Gas" class="headerlink" title="More Information About Gas"></a><strong>More Information About Gas</strong></h2><ul>
<li>A standard TX will be <code>21000</code> gas &amp; a gas price of <code>0.00000002 ETH</code> so the total TX fee will be <code>0.00042 ETH</code>.</li>
<li>With tokens, the amount of gas is typically 50000 gas - 100000 gas, so the total TX fee increases to <code>0.001 ETH - 0.002 ETH</code>.</li>
<li>The amount of ETH or tokens you are sending does not affect the amount of gas you need.</li>
<li><strong>Gas <em>limit</em></strong> is the maximum amount of gas you will send with your transaction. This is in units of gas.</li>
<li><strong>Gas <em>price</em></strong>, which you will not see except on the Offline page, is how much each unit of gas costs. We set it at <code>0.00000002 ETH</code>.</li>

<p>MyEtherWallet does not manage accounts with information such as passwords, private keys, or emails. In order to ensure your security and privacy, no sensitive data is ever saved, stored, or transmitted when you use MyEtherWallet. We only have access to the information that is publicly available on the blockchain. We do not have servers and we do not hold your assets.</p>
<p>Only users themselves can access and control their funds – this is the purpose of decentralized networks. Your funds are stored on the Ethereum blockchain itself, and we are simply an interface that allows you to easily interact with them. Passwords and private keys are in the users’ hands and are the users’ responsibility.</p>
<h2 id="Unfortunately-this-means-we-cannot"><a href="#Unfortunately-this-means-we-cannot" class="headerlink" title="Unfortunately, this means we cannot:"></a><strong>Unfortunately, this means we cannot:</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Recover your private key</li>
<li>Access your account</li>
<li>Recover or reset your password</li>
<li>Reverse or cancel transactions</li>
<li>Recover your account</li>
<li>Send your ETH or Tokens from one address to another</li>

<li>Do a full search of your computer for ‘UTC–’ and see if the file shows up.</li>
<li>Do a full search of your computer for your address, without the <code>0x</code> at the beginning.</li>
<li>If you know when you created it, look through all files during that time period for any documents or screenshots.</li>
<li>Generate a new wallet via our interface and take a look at the different options you may have downloaded or saved. Sometimes backtracking can help jog your memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the future, we strongly recommend you use our companion app <a href>MEWconnect</a>, or purchase <a href>a hardware wallet</a> for higher security. If you must use a private key, print out a paper version of your wallet, keep it in multiple physical locations, and only use it with an <a href>offline version of MEW</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click “Create New Wallet”.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Pick a strong password.</p>
<p>This step is very important. Make sure you pick a password that is not easy to guess, but also write it down with pen and paper. If you forget it, we cannot recover it for you. There is only one other way<br>to access your wallet, and we’ll get to that soon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Type it again.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Click “Start using MEWconnect”.</p>
<p>You’re done! You’ll be taken to a screen that shows your new wallets address backed by a unique color-code. On this screen you’ll find all your ETH and ERC20 tokens. There is also a handy ‘Share’ button next to your address, in case you want to send it to someone.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Enter in your password to verify you’re you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> WRITE DOWN YOUR SEED WORDS.</p>
<p>This is the single most important piece of information about your wallet. These 24 words will decide the future of your funds. Do not lose them, and do not screenshot them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong>  Pass the seed word check test.</p>
<p>You’re done! All backed up and ready to connect to MEW<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

<p>Check for the SSL certification that states ‘MyEtherWallet Inc [US]’ in   the URL. We recommend the Google Chrome browser.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Choose the ‘Send Ether &amp; Tokens’ tab.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click ‘MEW Connect’ as the method of access.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> On the app, click ‘Scan to Connect’.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Now use MEWconnect to scan the QR code.</p>
<p>You’re done! You can now use our interface as usual, with the MEWconnect app as your main method of access. Congratulations!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

<p>These can be found at the bottom of the wallet screen. MEWconnect only supports the default list of tokens featured on MyEtherWallet.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong>  Where to contact us.</p>
<p>There is an information button in the top-left, that offers a contact  resource and other links of interest.</p>

<h4 id="Look-for"><a href="#Look-for" class="headerlink" title="Look for:"></a><strong>Look for:</strong></h4><ul>
<li>An outgoing transaction (which shows as orange) to <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x6090a6e47849629b7245dfa1ca21d94cd15878ef" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ENS-Registrar</a>.</li>
<li>It should have an ETH value <code>&gt;= 0.01 ETH</code> (not one that says <code>0 ETH</code>).</li>
<li>If you are just now revealing your bid, it will be a transaction sent 2 - 4 days ago.</li>
<li>When you click on the transaction hash, it should show ‘Function: newBid(bytes32 sealedBid)’ under ‘Input Data’.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you find this, copy and paste the value in the ‘Input Data’ into a text document and remove ‘MethodId:’ and ‘[0]:’, so that it looks like this: </p>
<p><code>0xce92dced69faf18dd0953d9124d7917234b0efc05c78fd0d9abfc6ffb32d512680fdbb65</code></p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Depending on what you initially saved, enter the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The address you bid from<br>ENS Name you Bid On (no ‘.eth’ at the end!), or the namehash from your long string under “Hashed ENS Name (Label Hash)”</li>
<li>The amount you bid</li>
<li>Your Secret, or the sha3 secret from your long string under “Your Secret (Hashed)”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> When you do this, the following four fields will populate with long data. You want compare the string you copied earlier, <code>0xce92dced69faf18dd0953d9124d7917234b0efc05c78fd0d9abfc6ffb32d512680fdbb65</code>, to the string shown under ‘New Bid Data’. These two should match.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Pro-Tip: Copy the finalize data from this page and save it somewhere. This will allow you to easily finalize the transaction in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Copy the ‘Reveal Data’ string.</p>
<h2 id="Send-Transaction-to-Reveal"><a href="#Send-Transaction-to-Reveal" class="headerlink" title="Send Transaction to Reveal"></a><strong>Send Transaction to Reveal</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> In a new tab, head to our website and access the wallet for the address that you placed the bid on. This address should also be the same address entered in Step 2 of the previous section.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Enter the following information into the fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>To: <code>0x6090a6e47849629b7245dfa1ca21d94cd15878ef</code></li>
<li>Amount: <code>0 ETH</code></li>
<li>Gas Limit: <code>200000</code></li>
<li>Data: From the ‘Reveal Data’ field from Step 5 of the previous section.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Generate and sign your transaction.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click your transaction hash after you send it. Ensure there are no errors (you may have to refresh after a minute or two.)</p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> In a new tab, head to <a href="https://etherscan.io/enslookup?q=yourname.eth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan’s ENS Lookup</a> interface and type in the name you bid on. Make sure that you see a very recent transaction from your address with ‘Unseal Bid’ next to it.</p>

<p>First, it’s important to tell <a href>the difference between an exchange and MyEtherWallet (MEW)</a>. </p>
<h2 id="Let’s-review"><a href="#Let’s-review" class="headerlink" title="Let’s review:"></a><strong>Let’s review:</strong></h2><ul>
<li>MyEtherWallet (MEW) is not an exchange.</li>
<li>MEW does not hold your information or funds. </li>
<li>The user is in complete control of their security. This means:<ul>
<li>If you lose your private key, we cannot retrieve it. </li>
<li>If you forget your password, we cannot locate or reset it.</li>
<li>We cannot reverse or refund any transactions. </li>
<li>If you are phished, the only way for the attacker to get your information is through your own use. We never had it.</li>
<li>We cannot look up your attacker’s IP address or information.</li>
<li>We only have access to the information that is publicly available on the blockchain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are decentralized, meaning there are no central servers or powers to control everything. MEW is client-side and acts as a doorway to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. In the same way that a door does not know who’s using it, cannot restore accounts, and cannot hold funds, neither can we.</p>
<p>What we DO offer is freedom and a true sense of security. You gain complete control over your finances and information. You have the security of knowing that even if MEW shut down, you could still access your funds with a number of other decentralized ETH wallet platforms, or even directly on the blockchain itself. You are the only one with your information, and if MEW gets hacked, it won’t affect you. Because your funds and usage are not stored in MEW. They are on the blockchain, and you access them anonymously. </p>
<p>Once you’ve made the distinction, you’ll be ready to <a href>create your MEW wallet</a>. Before you do that, though, we suggest you read through our <a href>‘Getting Started’</a> category. It contains all the knowledge you need to begin your crypto journey with confidence. </p>

<p>The Ethereum network requires gas to execute transactions. Ether (ETH) is the fuel used for this purpose. When you send tokens, interact with a contract, send ETH, or do anything else on the blockchain, you must pay for that computation. That payment is calculated in gas, and gas is always paid in ETH.</p>
<p>You are paying for the computation, regardless of whether your transaction succeeds or fails. Even if it fails, the miners must validate and execute your transaction, which takes computational power. You must pay for that computation, just like you would pay for a successful transaction.</p>
<p>You can see your transaction fee (gas limit * gas price) in ETH &amp; USD when you search for your transaction on Etherscan.io.</p>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a fee that MyEtherWallet, or any other service provider, receives. This fee is paid to miners for mining transactions, validating them into blocks, and securing the blockchain.</p>

<li>All ETH and ERC20 tokens are stored on the Ethereum blockchain.</li>
<li>When using any site, exchange, hardware wallet, or interface based on the blockchain, all crypto is stored on the blockchain itself. These platforms and hardware wallets just allow us to interact with the blockchain in a simplified way.</li>

<p>Be sure there is not a space at the beginning or end of your private key. We validate based on the number of characters. A private key has 64 characters, count to make sure you have all 64. If you saved another version (i.e. the UTC / Keystore file) it may also be worth trying that file as well. For more information about how to use a Keystore file, learn how to <a href>access your wallet</a>.</p>
<p>Please be sure that you are <strong>carefully and accurately</strong> typing your private key. A single wrong character will open a different wallet than is yours.</p>
<p>Some wallets, like Exodus, may export a private key that begins with <code>0x</code>. If you remove these two characters from the beginning, you may be able to access your account.</p>
<p>For reference private key looks like this:<br><code>afdfd9c3d2095ef696594f6cedcae59e72dcd697e2a7521b1578140422a4f890</code></p>

<p><strong>1. Install <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EAL</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/phishfort-protect/bdiohckpogchppdldbckcdjlklanhkfc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PhishFort</a>, or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptonite-by-metacert/keghdcpemohlojlglbiegihkljkgnige" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cryptonite</a>.</strong> These Chrome Extensions warn you when visiting malicious sites.<br><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>2. Never click a link sent to you, even if it looks like it was sent by a legitimate crypto company.</strong> Search for the service on Google, and find the information there. (Make sure it’s not an ad!)</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/security/ProTip1.jpg" width=" 65%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>3. You will never have to enter your private key for any service, airdrop, or KYC verification.</strong> Do not give your private key to anyone!<br><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>4. Check the URL very closely, to make sure it’s the one you are expecting.</strong> Phishers are very clever with their tiny dots and accents. Bookmark all the sites you frequent most!</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/security/ProTip2.jpg" width=" 65%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>5. Always Google search any token sales or ICOs you’re interested in.</strong> If it’s a scam, others will likely be posting about it. Check their Twitter, Reddit, etc. (Follow us on Twitter and Reddit while you’re at it!)</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/security/ProTip3.jpg" width=" 65%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>6. Search smart, and look for common signs of scams – lack of followers in common, angry comments, etc.</strong> Remember, there are many fake bots and accounts out there!</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/security/ProTip4.jpg" width=" 65%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>7. Before sending crypto to any address, search it on Etherscan first.</strong> There is a comment section there that is likely to be full of angry people if the address is known for stealing funds.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/security/ProTip5.jpg" width=" 65%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>8. Double and triple-check everything!</strong> Make sure every address is 100% correct, as even one wrong character will lead to a completely different wallet. We cannot reverse or refund transactions, so this is very important!<br><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>9. Make sure the URL at the top of your interface shows that you are on our correct site, MyEtherWallet.com.</strong> Be cautious of any tiny dots or accents over the letters. Seeing these means you’re on a fake site.<br><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>10. Last, but not least, don’t be afraid to ask for help!</strong> We can always be reached at <a href="mailto:support@myetherwallet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support@myetherwallet.com</a>. Our support team is happy to help with any issue, big or small.<br><br><br><br></p>

<p>MyEtherWallet (MEW) is a front-end interface that enables direct interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. Any Ethereum address (0x….) can hold both ETH and ERC20 tokens. MEW allows users to manage a variety of different funds on a single address.</p>
<p>Many exchanges will give separate addresses for separate tokens, but this is not necessary on MEW. Whether you store all your funds on one address or spread your crypto portfolio across multiple addresses is ultimately up to you. </p>
<p>Some users prefer to have their funds distributed across multiple addresses for the purposes of security, organization, or personal preference. Others find that keeping track of one wallet is easier. We suggest using whichever method best fits your needs.</p>
<p>However, remember that all Ethereum blockchain transactions require gas, which is always paid in ETH. We recommend having at least .01 ETH on all your addresses, for sending transactions when needed. Also, make sure to keep all your information organized. The more addresses you have, the easier it can be to lose track and forget essential details about your wallets.</p>

<p>Time-constricted transactions can be tough in times of high volume due to various factors, like the transaction queue, ongoing token sales, the current state of the network, etc.</p>
<p>If you sent coins or tokens to the specified swap address, but have not received your funds in return, please reach out to both <a href="mailto:support@myetherwallet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support@myetherwallet.com</a> and whichever exchange you completed the swap through.

<p>We recommend going back to our swap section and clicking the ‘Issue with your Swap? Contact support.’ link at the bottom of the page. Or, click <a href>here</a>.</p>

<p>Here at MyEtherWallet (MEW), we’re all about fostering a seamless user experience, built on a foundation of security. This is why we’ve partnered with multiple exchanges, such as Bity, Kyber Network, and Changelly, to bring you competitive price points for your swaps.</p>
<p>To utilize our swap feature, first you must <a href>access your wallet</a>. </p>
<p>In the wallet overview area of your account, you’ll see a ‘Swap’ option to the left. Click there to be redirected to our exchanging interface. </p>
<p>Choose the cryptocurrency you’d like to swap, and the second list will auto-populate with the choices we offer for that swap. The bottom of our interface will show which exchange is offering this price point, compared to other exchanges. </p>
<p>If all the information looks correct to you, simply enter the address you’d like to send the new funds to (feel free to use the same address as the one you’re sending from!) and press ‘Continue’. </p>
<p>A timer of 10 minutes will begin for you to review all your information, confirm the details, and send the transaction.</p>
<p>If you have issues with your swap, please reach out to the relevant exchange’s support team. Their emails are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bity - <a href="mailto:mew@bity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mew@bity.com</a></li>
<li>Kyber Network - <a href="mailto:support@kyber.network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support@kyber.network</a> </li>
<li>Changelly - </li>
</ul>
<p>In case you don’t see your tokens or coins available for swapping on MEW, we have made a short list of reputable exchanges we are familiar with. They all offer services to buy, sell, and swap various cryptocurrencies. </p>

<p>Not all exchanges support all coins and fiat types, so take a look around to find one that fits your location and circumstances. Always google ‘scam + exchange name’ and read about people’s experiences before choosing to send to a random service or website.</p>

<p>Often times, a combination of new users, increased interest in Ethereum, games like CryptoKitties, and random ICOs can create quite a mess of the transaction pool, causing a lot of transactions to remain pending longer than usual. This is a network issue that affects all exchanges and ETH users.</p>
<p>There is simply not enough space in the blocks for the miners to mine all the transactions, and many systems are not currently set up to monitor the massive quantity of transaction requests. This is affecting all people’s ability to send transactions.</p>
<h2 id="Helpful-Tools-and-Resources-to-Get-Your-Transaction-to-Send"><a href="#Helpful-Tools-and-Resources-to-Get-Your-Transaction-to-Send" class="headerlink" title="Helpful Tools and Resources to Get Your Transaction to Send"></a><strong>Helpful Tools and Resources to Get Your Transaction to Send</strong></h2><ul>
<li>See all the transactions that are pending <a href>here</a>.</li>
<li><a href>Learn about transaction fees (gas)</a>, and how to get your transaction to go through.</li>
<li>Replace a pending transaction that you sent with too low gas.</li>
<li>See what the optimal gas price currently is <a href>here</a>.</li>
<li><a href>Learn about Nonce</a>, and how it controls which transactions are mined (or not).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Other-Tips"><a href="#Other-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Other Tips"></a><strong>Other Tips</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Try switching the network in the top-right to use a different node. There are multiple nodes that allow you to interact with ETH. We default to ‘MyEtherWallet.com’, but also offer Etherscan.io, Infura.io, and Giveth.io. If one is not working, try another one.</li>
<li>If you sent <strong>FROM</strong> an exchange, your best bet is to just be patient. Their support teams are generally flooded with requests (as are ours!), so patience is the best option.</li>
<li>There are additional issues created by this increased traffic that can result in unclear error messages on MyEtherWallet. We’re sorry for this, and we’re working on improving those messages. If you get an error, try pressing the generate button again, or changing the network via the dropdown in the top-right. However, be careful that you don’t actually send the same transaction twice. If it says “transaction hash already imported” or “same nonce”, you MAY have already sent that transaction, and it’s waiting to be mined. If both transactions get mined, you will send twice as much as you mean to.</li>

<p>You can use both MyEtherWallet (MEW) and Jaxx at the same time, as both are client-side wallets that allow access to the Ethereum blockchain. There is no need to ‘import’ or ‘sweep’ your ETH from your Jaxx wallet to a new wallet with MEW.</p>
<p>Instead, use your Jaxx 12-word mnemonic phrase to <a href>access your wallet</a>. You will derive multiple addresses, choose the one you are familiar with. Both ETH and ETC can be accessed via this address, as well as various other networks we support.</p>
<p>To access your ETC (or other networks), access your wallet and change your network in the upper-right hand corner of your wallet’s interface. We offer multiple nodes for ETC, so choose whichever is right for you. (Don’t overthink it.)</p>

<p>Many users use MetaMask for it’s ease of use and integration with many popular crypto sites, but they still want to have the functionality that MEW offers. For this reason, we offer support for MetaMask wallets right in our interface. Connecting is simple!</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure it’s the legitimate extension.<br>Are there a lot of users and positive reviews? </li>
<li>Is it offered by MetaMask.io? </li>
<li>If all of the above is true, you’re likely on the correct one.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Create your wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to choose a difficult password and record it on physical paper, just in case.</li>
<li>Follow the steps carefully, and make sure you write down the 12-word recovery phrase offered by the extension. This will be the only form of recovery for your wallet. Keep it safe.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Log into MetaMask and familiarize yourself with your new wallet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take special note of your public address (0x..).</li>

<p>Ledger Hardware Wallets are some of the most secure and intuitive cryptocurrency hardware wallets out there. They are available for purchase <a href>here</a>. </p>
<ul>
<li>*Please purchase hardware wallets from the original source. Hardware wallets bought off ebay or from other vendors cannot be guaranteed secure.</li>
</ul>
<p>This particular hardware wallet supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, but this guide is specifically made for accessing Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens while using MyEtherWallet (MEW). </p>
<p><strong>This part is very important.</strong> Your Ledger device comes as its own SEPARATE wallet. You cannot import your old MEW address into this, or use your old wallet with it. It has its own private key, encrypted into the device itself. You will be choosing a new ethereum address on this device, and using it as your new main wallet.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s begin!</p>
<h2 id="The-Initial-Set-Up"><a href="#The-Initial-Set-Up" class="headerlink" title="The Initial Set-Up"></a><strong>The Initial Set-Up</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Unbox your Ledger! You will see some cards and instructions for set-up. Follow these instructions carefully! Plug in the Ledger to your computer and get started. Press both buttons at the top of the Ledger to navigate past the first screen, seen above.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/welcome.jpg" width="50%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> There are two buttons on the Ledger. Use these to navigate the device. When setting up your new device for the first time, choose the button on the right to select the check mark, indicating ‘yes’.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/configure-as-new-device.jpg" width="50%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Set up a PIN code to access your Ledger. Make it something that is very easy to remember for you. Write it down in a couple places. Remember it!! This is how you will unlock your Ledger everytime you want to access it. The PIN code must be between 4 and 8 characters, and it can be changed after set-up. However, if you get the PIN code wrong three times in a row, the device will reset. Be careful!</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/choose-pin.jpg" width="50%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> This is one of the most important steps. Do not write this phrase down on your computer, do not take a picture of the phrase. Make sure you write down your 24 seed words in multiple places. DO NOT LOSE THEM. If you lose these words, you’ve lost all your cryptocurrency. Ledger provides cards for you to write them down for remembering, but I suggest writing them down in one extra place as well. Again, do not write this phrase down on your computer. Use pen and paper.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/write-down-recovery.jpg" width="50%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Great, your device is now ready! Now let’s figure out how to use it with MyEtherWallet.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/device-ready.jpg" width="50%"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
<h2 id="Using-Ledger-with-MEW"><a href="#Using-Ledger-with-MEW" class="headerlink" title="Using Ledger with MEW"></a><strong>Using Ledger with MEW</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Attach and unlock your Ledger device. You should see a few different sections to choose from, choose the Ethereum section as shown above. Click both buttons to open it.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/ethereum-app.jpg" width="50%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click into this Setting section with both buttons.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/ethereum-settings.jpg" width="50%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will see “Contract Data” in this section. Make sure this option is turned to “Yes”.<br><br><br><br></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Good job, it’s all ready now! Head back to the “Ethereum” section and leave your Ledger alone for a moment. Let’s head to MEW!<br><br><br><br></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Check the URL for the “MyEtherWallet Inc [US]” SSL certification to make sure you’re on our real, secure site. Are you? Great! Head to ‘Access My Wallet’ and choose the option that says ‘Hardware’. Click the ‘Ledger Wallet’ option, and choose ‘Connect With Your Device’ with your Ledger device still attached, unlocked, and ready.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/MEW1.png" width="75%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> A screen showing different networks and derivation paths should appear. Choose which network you’d like to connect to, and which path you’d like to use. For regular ETH usage, you should be on an ETH network, under the Ethereum derivation path. You can also access other networks, such as Ethereum Classic (ETC), by choosing the related network path. </p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/MEW2.png" width="70%"></p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/Ledger1.png" width="70%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> You will see a list of addresses. These are your new addresses to choose from for your main wallet! Choose one out of the five that you like. (Most people choose the first one, but you don’t have to.)</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/Ledger2.png" width="41.3%"> <img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/Ledger3.png" width="50%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 8.</strong> You should now be taken to a screen that looks very similar to your old wallet’s access screen. Great job! You’re officially using your new Ledger hardware wallet! </p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/ledger/LEdger4.png" width="50%"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
<h2 id="What-About-My-Old-Wallet"><a href="#What-About-My-Old-Wallet" class="headerlink" title="What About My Old Wallet???"></a><strong>What About My Old Wallet???</strong></h2><p>If you are coming from an old wallet and want your ETH and tokens on your new, secure Ledger address, you will need to send your funds to your new address through a regular transaction. This can be achieved by accessing your old wallet through MEWconnect, MetaMask, Keystore file, or private key (however you usually did it before the Ledger). From here, send your ETH and tokens to your new Ledger address, ready to be accessed in a more secure fashion.</p>
<p>Please be advised ETH will be required for gas to move any tokens held in your old wallet. We recommend holding .01 ETH to cover 2 - 3 transactions.</p>
<h2 id="How-Do-I-Restore-My-Ledger-to-a-New-Device"><a href="#How-Do-I-Restore-My-Ledger-to-a-New-Device" class="headerlink" title="How Do I Restore My Ledger to a New Device?"></a><strong>How Do I Restore My Ledger to a New Device?</strong></h2><p>Ledger made a clear and easy to follow guide on how to restore your Ledger device <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005434914-Restore-from-recovery-phrase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Troubleshooting"><a href="#Troubleshooting" class="headerlink" title="Troubleshooting"></a><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></h2><p>Most issues with the Ledger can be fixed by performing a hard refresh (using CTRL+F5), making sure Contract Data is turned to ‘Yes’, confirming that all the firmware is updated to its latest release, and trying a new connecting cable. </p>
<p>If these troubleshooting options did not fix your issue, MEW has an extensive knowledge base that you can find <a href>here</a>. There is a big chance that it’s already listed under ‘Common Issues’. If not, feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:support@myetherwallet.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support@myetherwallet.com</a>. We are always happy to help!</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor1.jpg" width="35%"><br><br><br><br><br></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Choose ‘Create new’ on this page, and follow the steps to set up your new device.The first thing you will want to do is ‘Create a backup in 3 minutes.’ </p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor2.png" width="80%"><br><br><br><br><br></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> <em>This is one of the most important steps.</em> Do not write this phrase down on your computer, do not take a picture of the phrase.

<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor4.png" width="75%"><br><br><br><br><br></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Now you will be prompted to choose a name for your Trezor. This is the name you will see on your device whenever you plug it in. Choose something familiar and personal!</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor5.png" width="70%"></p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hardware-wallet/trezor/Trezor6.png" width="75%"><br><br><br><br><br></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> You will now choose your pin. This pin will be the only way to access your device (besides the recovery phrase you wrote down, multiple times) so it’s very important to choose a secure, but easy to remember pin. Don’t just use <code>1111</code> or <code>1234</code>, use something a bit more random and secure.<br><em>Don’t make this mistake! If it says it could be safer, make it longer!</em></p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> A screen will pop-up asking for you to allow MEW permissions to read the public keys from your Trezor device. Click ‘Allow once for this session’, and feel free to select ‘Don’t ask me again’, so this step is automatic in the future. Select ‘Export’ on the next screen, enter your pin, and you’ll be redirected back to MEW. </p>

<p>If you would like to use your Ledger hardware wallet with an android device, there are a couple things you will need to prepare in advance.</p>
<h2 id="Requirements"><a href="#Requirements" class="headerlink" title="Requirements"></a><strong>Requirements</strong></h2><ul>
<li><p>Modern android phone or tablet, supporting USB On-The-Go (USB-OTG).</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re not sure of USB-OTG support, check it yourself using an app like the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.faitaujapon.otg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USB-OTB Checker</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A USB-OTG adapter (found on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=usb+otg+adapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a> for a couple bucks).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Setting-Up-Your-Device"><a href="#Setting-Up-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Setting Up Your Device"></a><strong>Setting Up Your Device</strong></h2><p>Before connecting to your Ledger, you first have to install a <a href="https://github.com/LedgerHQ/android-u2f-bridge/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ledger application</a>. Click that URL on your Android device, and select the file <code>android-u2f-bridge-x.x.apk</code>. Once downloaded, open this file on your device and install it. Click ‘done’ when you are finished.</p>
<p>Now you can connect your Ledger hardware wallet and open the Ethereum app. Make sure ‘Contract Data’ is turned on. Now open your browser and head to MyEtherWallet.com. Under ‘Access My Wallet’, choose the ‘Hardware’ option and click ‘Ledger Wallet’ to connect to your device.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/diving-deeper/ledger-hardware-wallet-using-with-android-01.png" width="50%"></p>
<p>You should see this pop-up, asking to allow the app Ledger U2F to access the USB device. Select ‘OK’, and you will be connected to your Ledger!</p>

<h2 id="Short-answer"><a href="#Short-answer" class="headerlink" title="Short answer:"></a><strong>Short answer:</strong></h2><p>Nothing, besides looking for another wallet.</p>
<h2 id="Longer-answer"><a href="#Longer-answer" class="headerlink" title="Longer answer:"></a><strong>Longer answer:</strong></h2><p>Your funds and information are not ‘in’ MyEtherWallet (MEW). Your wallet exists on the blockchain itself, and MEW just offers a way for anyone to interact with the blockchain easily. If MEW went down, you would simply have to find another Ethereum blockchain interface that would allow you to access your wallet. </p>
<p>The information used to unlock your MEW wallet is the same information that can be used to unlock your wallet on another platform. We always suggest doing research before entering your information into an unfamiliar site.</p>
<p>You can import your unencrypted private key and your Geth/Mist Format (encrypted) files directly into geth / Ethereum Wallet / Mist very easily.</p>
<p>You can also <a href>run MyEtherWallet locally</a> and/or <a href>connect it to your own node</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>The Ethereum blockchain is a network. Ether (ETH) is the fuel for that network. When you send tokens, interact with a contract, send ETH or ERC20 tokens, or do anything else on the blockchain, you must pay for that computation. That payment is calculated in gas, and gas is always paid in ETH.</p>
<p>You are paying for the computation, regardless of whether your transaction succeeds or fails. Even if it fails, the miners must validate and execute your transaction, which takes computational power. You must pay for that computation just like you would pay for a successful transaction.</p>
<p>You can see your transaction fee (gas limit * gas price) in ETH &amp; USD when you search for your transaction on Etherscan.io. This is not a fee that MyEtherWallet (MEW), or any other service provider, receives. This fee is paid to the remote miners for mining transactions, putting them into blocks, and securing the blockchain.</p>
<h2 id="Overview"><a href="#Overview" class="headerlink" title="Overview"></a><strong>Overview</strong></h2><p>When you hear the term ‘gas’, the person speaking is either talking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gas Limit</li>
<li>Gas Price</li>
</ul>
<p>The total cost of a transaction (the “transaction fee”) is the Gas Limit * Gas Price.</p>
<p>You can think of the gas limit as the total amount of liters/gallons/units of gas a car can hold. </p>
<p>You can think of the gas price as the cost of that liter/gallon/unit of gas.</p>
<ul>
<li>With a car, it’s <code>$2.50</code> (price) per gallon (unit).</li>
<li>With Ethereum, it’s <code>20 GWEI</code> (price) per gas (unit).</li>
</ul>
<p>So let’s say you want to fill up your 10 gallon tank.<br>It would take 10 gallons of gas, at <code>$2.50</code> each. That total would come out to <code>$25</code>.</p>
<p>Likewise, fulfilling a gas limit of <code>21000</code> means filling <code>21000</code> units of gas.<br>If each unit is set at <code>20 GWEI</code>, your total would come out to <code>0.00042</code>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the total transaction fee in this scenario would be <code>0.00042 ETH</code>.</p>
<p>Sending tokens will typically take a gas limit of <code>50000 - 100000</code>, so the total transaction fee increases to <code>0.001 ETH - 0.002 ETH</code>.</p>
<p>You can use our tool to calculate GWEI <-> WEI <-> USD <a href>here</a>, which can be helpful when you want to know your transaction fee in ETH, rather than GWEI.</-></-></p>
<h2 id="Gas-Limit"><a href="#Gas-Limit" class="headerlink" title="Gas Limit"></a><strong>Gas Limit</strong></h2><p>The gas limit is called the limit because it’s the maximum amount of units of gas you are willing to spend on a transaction. This avoids situations where there is an error somewhere in a contract, and you end up spending <code>1 ETH</code>, then <code>10 ETH</code>, and then <code>1000 ETH</code>, going in circles but arriving no where.</p>
<p>However, the units of gas necessary for a transaction are already defined by how much code is executed on the blockchain. If you do not want to spend as much on gas, lowering the gas limit won’t help much. You must include enough gas to cover the computational resources you use or your transaction will fail due to an ‘Out of Gas’ error.</p>
<p>All unused gas never leaves your wallet. So if you go to MyEtherWallet, send <code>1 ETH</code> to our donation address, and use a gas limit of <code>400000</code>, you will receive <code>400000 - 21000* = 379000</code> back. However, if you were sending <code>1 ETH</code> to a contract, and your transaction to the contract fails (say, the Token Creation Period is already over), you will use the entire <code>400000</code> and receive nothing back.</p>
<p><em>*<code>21000</code> is the standard gas limit for regular transactions.</em></p>
<h2 id="Gas-Price"><a href="#Gas-Price" class="headerlink" title="Gas Price"></a><strong>Gas Price</strong></h2><p>If you want to spend less on a transaction, you can do so by lowering the amount you pay per unit of gas. The price you pay for each unit increases or decreases how quickly your transaction will be mined.</p>
<h2 id="During-normal-times-a-gas-price-of"><a href="#During-normal-times-a-gas-price-of" class="headerlink" title="During normal times, a gas price of:"></a><strong>During normal times, a gas price of:</strong></h2><ul>
<li><code>40 GWEI</code> will almost always get you into the next block.</li>
<li><code>20 GWEI</code> will usually get you within the next few blocks.</li>
<li><code>2 GWEI</code> will usually get you within the next few minutes.</li>
</ul>

<li><p><code>50 GWEI</code> is the max gas price most new token creation period contracts will accept. Anything above that and your transaction will fail. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Most</em> is the keyword here. Check with the token creation period you wish to invest in before said token creation period begins.</li>
<li><code>50 GWEI</code> would be the amount you should send in these cases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If you are trying to send during a token creation period (but not to the token creation), you have 2 choices: </p>
<ul>
<li>Wait a bit until the token creation period is over. </li>
<li>Increase the gas price over <code>50 GWEI</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can adjust the gas price on MyEtherWallet in the footer via a slider. </p>

Does setting a low gas price mean it won’t ever be mined?"></a><strong>Will increasing the gas price get it mined faster? Does setting a low gas price mean it won’t ever be mined?</strong></h2><p>The transaction fees go to the miner who mines your block. When miners mine a block, they have to decide which transactions to include. They can choose to include no transactions, or they can choose to randomly select transactions. In order to encourage miners to include transactions in blocks you want to set a ‘gas price’ that is high enough to make them want to include it (since it is entirely up to them).</p>
<p><em>Most</em> miners follow a very simple strategy for inclusion. They include transactions they received sorted from highest gas price to lowest, then include them until either the block is full, or they reach one that has a gas price set lower than they are willing to bother with.</p>
<p>You want to set the gas price high enough so that a miner includes your transaction in a block. If you are in a hurry, you can set the gas price even higher, so that you jump ahead of everyone in line.</p>
<p>If you are not in a hurry, you just need to set a number high enough so that someone eventually includes your transaction.</p>
<h2 id="Why-should-I-set-a-low-gas-price"><a href="#Why-should-I-set-a-low-gas-price" class="headerlink" title="Why should I set a low gas price?"></a><strong>Why should I set a low gas price?</strong></h2><p>Because it’s cheaper, and because with the increasing price of ETH (compared to USD), a transaction that used to cost half a cent, may now cost a few cents. </p>
<p>More expensive transactions, like bidding on an ENS name, can now cost a dollar or more! As a user, you should try sending non-urgent transactions with a lower gas price as the more transactions that occur at the lower gas price, the more likely miners will lower their minimums.</p>
<h2 id="Should-I-increase-the-gas-limit-for-token-sales"><a href="#Should-I-increase-the-gas-limit-for-token-sales" class="headerlink" title="Should I increase the gas limit for token sales?"></a><strong>Should I increase the gas limit for token sales?</strong></h2><p>You should put whatever the token sale holders tell you to put. If you do not know, then ask before the token sale. This ensures that your transaction won’t fail due to an ‘Out of Gas’ error. Typically, a <code>200000</code> gas limit will be enough, but some may require more.</p>
<p>Increasing the amount to <code>1500000</code> or more will not increase the likelihood of getting in. All it will do is fill up the blocks faster, and you will lose that transaction fee if it doesn’t go through. We have never seen a token sale that requires over a <code>800000</code> gas limit.</p>
<h2 id="So-I-should-send-with-a-huge-gas-price-for-token-sales-right"><a href="#So-I-should-send-with-a-huge-gas-price-for-token-sales-right" class="headerlink" title="So I should send with a huge gas price for token sales, right?"></a><strong>So I should send with a huge gas price for token sales, right?</strong></h2><p>Not necessarily. The risk in increasing it is that you could still not get in, and pay the fee anyways.</p>
<p>The gas will <strong>not</strong> be returned to you if you send with a too-low gas limit, too early, or too late in the token creation period.</p>
<p>First, see if the token sale has a max gas price. If they do, use that as the gas price. Both Status and Bancor had a max gas of <code>50 GWEI</code>.</p>
<p>If they let you send with any amount of gas price, you should decide how much you are will to invest, and how much you are willing to spend on that attempt to invest. <strong><em>You must assume that you will pay the full fee and get nothing in return during token creation periods.</em></strong> Take the gas limit (i.e. <code>200000</code>), multiply that by the gas price (i.e. <code>50 GWEI</code> or <code>0.00000005 ETH</code>), and that is how much you will pay for your attempt to get in.</p>
<p>Before the BAT token creation period, the average gas price was <code>20 GWEI</code> (the default) for token creation periods. Now it’s all over the place:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>40 GWEI</code> * <code>200000</code> = <code>0.008 ETH</code> (or <code>$5.60 USD</code>).</li>
<li><code>70 GWEI</code> * <code>200000</code> = <code>0.014 ETH</code> (or <code>$9.80 USD</code>).</li>
<li><code>100 GWEI</code> * <code>200000</code> = <code>0.02 ETH</code> (or <code>$14.00 USD</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Example-Absurd-gas-prices-from-the-BAT-token-creation-period-USD-prices-at-time-of-transactions"><a href="#Example-Absurd-gas-prices-from-the-BAT-token-creation-period-USD-prices-at-time-of-transactions" class="headerlink" title="Example: Absurd gas prices from the BAT token creation period (USD prices at time of transactions)"></a><strong>Example: Absurd gas prices from the BAT token creation period (USD prices at time of transactions)</strong></h2><ul>
<li><code>118 GWEI</code> * <code>200000</code> = <code>0.0236 ETH</code> (or <code>$6.13 USD</code>).</li>
<li><code>7590 GWEI</code> * <code>200000</code> = <code>1.518 ETH</code> (or <code>$394.68 USD</code>).</li>
<li><code>58000 GWEI</code> * <code>200000</code> = <code>11.6 ETH</code> (or <code>$3,016 USD</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/posts/transactions/GasChartCrazy.jpg?raw=true" width="100%"></p>
<p>Someone paid <code>$6000+</code> to send a failed transaction. That can’t feel good.</p>

<p>(At the time of this writing) Below <code>20 GWEI</code> the blocks are almost all full, which means if you set lower than that you’ll have to wait in line with everyone else.</p>
<p>A very awesome miner, miningpoolhub, accepts a <code>2 GWEI</code> price, but their blocks are always full and they only account for <code>9%</code> of mining, which means about <code>1</code> in every <code>10</code> blocks (<code>~150 seconds</code>) will accept transactions with a <code>2 GWEI</code> gas price. And when it does, it is full, so you may have to wait for a few of those.</p>
<p><a href="https://ethgasstation.info/calculatorTxV.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EthGasStation’s Calculator</a> will let you estimate how long it will be before your transaction is accepted at a specific gas price.</p>

<p>In Ethereum, every transaction has a nonce. The nonce is the number of transactions sent from a given address.</p>
<p>In English, a nonce is a number that can only be used once. In cryptography, a nonce is a one-time code selected in a random or pseudo-random manner that is used to securely transmit a main password, preventing replay attacks.</p>
<p>Each time you send a transaction, the nonce value increases by <code>1</code>. There are rules about what transactions are considered valid transactions, and the nonce is used to enforce some of these rules. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Transactions must be in order.</strong> You cannot have a transaction with a nonce of <code>1</code> mined before one with a nonce of <code>0</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No skipping!</strong> You cannot have a transaction with a nonce of <code>2</code> mined if you have not already sent transactions with a nonce of <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-does-it-matter"><a href="#Why-does-it-matter" class="headerlink" title="Why does it matter?"></a><strong>Why does it matter?</strong></h2><p>This value prevents double-spending, as the nonce will always specify the order of transactions. If a double-spend <em>does</em> occur, it’s typically due to the following process:</p>
<ul>
<li>A transaction is sent to one party.</li>
<li>They wait for it to register.</li>
<li>Something is collected from this first transaction.</li>
<li>Another transaction is quickly sent with a high gas price.</li>
<li>The second transaction is mined first, therefore invalidating the first transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why exchanges wait for you to have a certain number of confirmations before allowing you to trade freshly-deposited funds.</p>
<h2 id="When-using-the-Ethereum-blockchain-the-above-is-not-possible"><a href="#When-using-the-Ethereum-blockchain-the-above-is-not-possible" class="headerlink" title="When using the Ethereum blockchain, the above is not possible."></a><strong>When using the Ethereum blockchain, the above is not possible.</strong></h2><p>In Ethereum, this method of “double-spending” is not possible because each transaction has a nonce included with it. Even if you attempt to do the above, it will not work as the second transaction (nonce of <code>3</code>) cannot be mined before the first transaction (nonce of <code>2</code>).</p>

<p>Your Keystore/JSON file holds an encrypted version of your private key, which is simply your private key encoded into a cool, secret string of characters. Take, for example, the word ‘apple’. If you encrypted this word with a 4-character difference down the alphabet, it would look something like ‘dssoh’. At face value, you’d have no idea what ‘dssoh’ meant. However, if you gave someone this word and told them the way you encrypted it, they could then decode it back to the world ‘apple’! This is a <strong>very</strong> simplified version of how encryption works, but it gets the point across.</p>
<p>When you enter your password upon generation of your wallet, it takes your password and uses it to encrypt your Private Key into a Keystore/JSON file. The result is a file that looks a lot like gibberish if you open it, (which there is no reason to do, do not open your JSON file!). This file simply holds your encrypted private key within it, which is why you have to use your chosen password to unlock your wallet via this method. You cannot change your password without generating an entirely new Keystore/JSON file.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the strength of your password is directly related to the integrity of your Keystore/JSON file. If you choose a weak password, and a hacker gets hold of your encrypted key, they can bruteforce it until they discover what password you used. Pick a strong password for a strong encryption! </p>
<h2 id="To-change-your-Keystore-JSON-file-password"><a href="#To-change-your-Keystore-JSON-file-password" class="headerlink" title="To change your Keystore/JSON file + password:"></a><strong>To change your Keystore/JSON file + password:</strong></h2><p>As mentioned above, you cannot change your password without generating a completely new JSON file. </p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install our <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/myetherwallet/nlbmnnijcnlegkjjpcfjclmcfggfefdm?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MEW Chrome Extension</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> In the extension, add a ‘new wallet’ by entering your private key. </p>
<ul>
<li>This does not mean generating an entirely new wallet. It means to add your existing wallet as a ‘new wallet’ into the extension.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Enter a strong password, and save the wallet. </p>
<ul>
<li>This will be the new password for your JSON file, so choose wisely.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Head to the ‘My Wallets’ area of the extension and click the small icon that looks like an eye. It should say ‘View’ when hovered over. </p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Enter in the password you just made.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> You will be taken to an area that shows your wallet’s information. You can download a new Keystore/JSON file from this area, and use that for future access.</p>
<p>After downloading the new Keystore/JSON file, you can choose to continue using our Chrome Extension, or go back to using regular MEW. However, since you’re using a Keystore/JSON file, we highly suggest learning <a href>how to use MEW offline</a>, for the security of your information.</p>

<p>Mnemonic phrases, also known as ‘seed words’ or ‘recovery phrases’, are ordered lists of 12 - 24 words which bring you to specific wallet addresses. These are typically used for recovery, and they are not meant to be used as the main method of access for anyone’s wallet. They can sometimes be paired with a password as well, for added encryption and security. </p>
<p>Mnemonic phrases are just as sensitive as your private key, in terms of privacy. With your phrase, anyone can permanently access your wallet. These phrases cannot be changed, so keeping them safe is crucial. </p>

<p>First, let’s look at what a contract is. A contract generally outlines a relationship between two parties, bound by law. If one party violates that contract, actions can be taken against them for essentially breaking the law. Many beginning users confuse contracts and smart contracts, and while they can hold similar functionality, they are used for different purposes.</p>
<p>A smart contract is a self-executing contract, written in code, the primary purpose of which is to achieve a goal without the interference of a middleman. Smart contracts can be used to exchange money, property, shares, data, or anything of real value, while remaining decentralized and transparent. The contract itself regulates what action is taken, based on its code. Smart contracts will always achieve the same end goal, based on what input is being used. While regular contracts are meant to be permanently (or temporarily) binding to the law, smart contracts actually are permanent. They make their own laws with their behavior. Using a smart contract for any other purpose than their primary one is impossible. They are immutable, bound to the Ethereum blockchain and unable to be edited. This may sound a bit complicated or confusing, so let’s view it in a different light. </p>
<p>The original creator of smart contract technology was Nick Szabo. In 1993, he hatched the idea for a system similar to a digital vending machine. A user could input a value or data string, and the digital machine would execute itself based on the input to return a finite item. This is how smart contracts were developed. A simple example of this would be a user sending ETH to their friend, but only at a specified time. They could create their own smart contract to send the funds at a later date, deposit their funds, and the smart contract would self-execute to send the funds as specified without any further external input. </p>
<p>The Ethereum blockchain was created specifically to write and execute smart contracts. While Bitcoin technically supported the very basic smart contract of transferring BTC, this is generally regarded as only the tip of the iceberg. With a little innovation and creativity, smart contracts can be built on top of one another to create completely decentralized applications (Dapps) and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). In these cases, each smart contract performs a function, which triggers another function in another contract, which continues to develop until a complicated action is completed without needing any centralized authority to monitor it. </p>
<h2 id="Some-generally-well-known-use-cases-for-smart-contracts-are"><a href="#Some-generally-well-known-use-cases-for-smart-contracts-are" class="headerlink" title="Some generally well-known use cases for smart contracts are:"></a><strong>Some generally well-known use cases for smart contracts are:</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Multi-signature wallets, which require a majority of the wallet’s owners to agree on spending before the contract executes.</li>
<li>Managing relationship agreements between two users, i.e. buying insurance or property ownership.</li>
<li>Providing information or utility for other contracts to pull from.</li>
<li>Storing information, such as personal information, medical data, membership records, consensus ledgers, etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>The use cases for smart contracts are endless. We are only beginning to scratch the surface of what this technology can offer, and how it will revolutionize the world. </p>

<p>ICO stands for ‘Initial Coin Offering’, also known as a ‘token sale’ or ‘crowdsale’. It is an unregulated fundraising method for startups. Start-up companies use these funds to further develop and complete their blockchain based software projects. It is similar to an IPO (Initial Public Offering), in which investors purchase shares of a company.</p>
<p>ICOs offer ‘tokens’ in return for users who support them by sending them ETH. When you give these ICO teams your ETH/BTC or other currencies, it means that you believe the technologies they are creating will bring value to the Ethereum community.</p>
<p>In the beginning of an ICO, the leading team will explain their vision and will normally provide a ‘white paper’. This white paper contains a lot of valuable information that you should read, even if you do not understand a lot of the technical terms. As long as you get a basic understanding of what the token is about, it will help in your decision making.</p>
<p>Take note of the team and web developers behind the ICO. Reputable programmers and business people usually mean that the ICO is legitimate, and that it has a lot of potential. Sometimes, these teams recruit well known Facebook developers or managers/Google employees, this is when you know that the token team is truly creating something valuable.</p>
<p>It is crucial to do your research on an ICO that you are interested in. ICO hype in the community has caused many people and fake companies to create ‘scam’ ICOs, simply because it is easy to raise money due to the hype created around the token. Scam ICOs usually execute the ‘pump and dump’ method for gaining maximum profits. Creating hype around a token is fairly easy to do, and you should try your best not to let FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) cloud your judgement. Hype can easily be created through posts on Reddit/Facebook/Slack/etc by people who are looking to make a quick buck with the pump and dump method.</p>
<p><strong>Pump and dump:</strong> When a token is full of hype and no backbone or actual real world value, a lot of people will ride the hype wave up. Everyone will see that the token is performing exceptionally well on exchanges and buy in, but there are also people who are ready to dump massive amounts of the token back into the exchanges (hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of the token, sometimes millions of dollars worth). Selling massive amounts of tokens back into the market causes the price to plummet, and then everyone else starts to panic and sell off to cut of loses.</p>
<p>The value of tokens/ETH/BTC/etc is all driven by the market. You have the ability to make the price go up or down. It follows the ‘supply and demand’ economic concept. If there are more people who want a token, but there is a limited supply of the token, the price increases. If no one wants the token, there is a surge of supply avaiable on the market, then the price decreases.</p>
<p>There are many successful and truly valuable technologies and concepts that have come out of ICOs, and that is a good thing. But you must always remain vigilant and do a lot of research before investing in anything.</p>

<p>Phishing and hacking are (unfortunately) very common in the crypto space. Don’t let it discourage you though, as most attacks are completely preventable. We will not be able to recover your funds for you, but we’re here to help however we can. Education is the biggest defense against these attacks. Being able to recognize and prepare yourself for future phishing attempts is very important. </p>
<h2 id="Step-1-Identify-the-method"><a href="#Step-1-Identify-the-method" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Identify the method."></a><strong>Step 1: Identify the method.</strong></h2><p>The first step is identifying how it happened. Phishers make their living by being sneaky, so being able to figure out their methodology will be tremendously helpful. </p>
<ul>
<li>Check your history. Have you recently visited any sketchy sites? Did you recently enter your information on a fake MEW after clicking a link? <ul>
<li>Look at the URLs. Do you see any tiny dots or accents over (or under) the letters?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scan your computer for malware. It’s possible your files have been compromised.</li>
<li>Do you have any remote-access software installed, i.e. Teamviewer? These can be hacked remotely to view the information right from your screen.</li>
<li>What method do you use to access your wallet? Private keys, keystore/JSON files, and mnemonic phrases are not generally recommended because they allow easy access to one’s wallet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Step-2-Make-a-new-wallet"><a href="#Step-2-Make-a-new-wallet" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Make a new wallet."></a><strong>Step 2: Make a new wallet.</strong></h2><p>Since your old wallet was compromised, you will need to discontinue its use and set up a new wallet. There are multiple safer options to choose from besides keystore/JSON files, mnemonic phrases, or private keys. </p>
<ul>
<li>The best thing you can do for your security is purchase a hardware wallet, such as the <a href>Ledger Nano S</a> or <a href>Trezor</a>. These are generally around ~$100, but can save you thousands in the long run. </li>
<li><a href>MEWconnect</a> is our free smartphone app, which offers hardware wallet security without all the hardware. With MEWconnect, you can view your balance on the go. To send a transaction, simply scan a QR code on MEW to unlock your wallet.</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MetaMask</a> is a free Google Chrome Extension that allows you to set up an Ethereum wallet, which can be used with MEW.

<ul>
<li>A great place to start is with our <a href>Knowledge Base</a>. MEW maintains a variety of articles that can help. Start with our <a href>Pro-Tips on how to avoid phishers</a>. </li>
<li>The force is strong with this community. Follow us on Twitter and Reddit for any current MEW-related scams or updates that might be going on.</li>
<li>Google everything! Before sending money to any service, search it on Google. Read people’s opinions on it, check Twitter and Reddit. Do your research!</li>

<li>Let people know on Twitter, Reddit, <a href="https://etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan</a>, etc. Blow up those comments. Let your voice be heard</li>
</ul>
<p>We know these attacks can be very demoralizing, but let it be an opportunity for learning. If these phishers deter you from using crypto, then they win. Show them that you’re a force to be reckoned with! </p>

<p>Your ETH &amp; ERC20 tokens are on the Ethereum blockchain, regardless of what service you use to access them. When you move them, you are sending them from one address on the blockchain to another. These are simply lines of code. Your wallet file, hardware wallet, the interface you interact with, or your private key  do not have funds in them. These are simply ways of access, which gives you the ability to prove ownership over coins that are on the blockchain itself.</p>
<p><strong>If you use a client-side tool like MyEtherWallet or Mist, Metamask, Exodus, or Jaxx,</strong> then you have the private key (or a similar method of access), and you control your funds <em>and</em> your key. You do not rely on Coinbase or Gemini sending your funds from their account to yours.</p>
<p>The upside is that you, and only you, control your keys. An exchange getting hacked won’t affect you. The downside is that you, <strong>and only you,</strong> control your keys. No one else has them, nor can they recover them, should they be lost.</p>
<p>If you do lose your private key or wallet file and password, you cannot prove ownership of an account, and you permanently lose access to your funds.</p>
<p><strong>If you use an exchange like Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken, Polonix, Bittrex,</strong> then you have an account with that company, and they hold your ETH and your keys for you. They have their own account on the blockchain with all their and their customers’ funds in it. Then you have a username / password with them, on their servers, and they keep track of how much ETH they “owe” you.</p>
<p>This allows you to have the more traditional username / password account dynamic and do things like reset your password if you forget it, change your password if your password is compromised, and turn on 2FA. However, it also means that if the exchange loses ETH, it’s your ETH that is lost.</p>
<p><strong>If you choose to move from an exchange to a wallet where you control your keys,</strong> you need to make sure that you have multiple backups, stored in separate locations, of your private key / keystore file / recovery phrase. This will prevent loss in case your computer crashes or your house burns down or anything else.</p>
<h2 id="You-also-need-to-ensure-you-keep-these-keys-secure-This-means"><a href="#You-also-need-to-ensure-you-keep-these-keys-secure-This-means" class="headerlink" title="You also need to ensure you keep these keys secure. This means:"></a><strong>You also need to ensure you keep these keys secure. This means:</strong></h2><ul>
<li>Don’t enter it on random websites.</li>
<li>Always ensure you are on the correct site or downloading from the legitimate repo / website.</li>
<li>Don’t email your key, send it to anyone, or post it online.</li>
<li>Don’t save it to cloud storage.</li>
<li>Don’t have Team Viewer or other remote access software on your computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this seems very overwhelming, we recommend purchasing a <a href="/">Ledger</a> or <a href="/">Trezor</a> hardware wallet. These help keep your keys safe and stored in an “offline” device, rather than on your computer. In this case, you don’t have to worry about files or strings of characters; instead you just connect your hardware wallet to your computer.</p>

<p>Lately, a lot of blockchain projects on Ethereum have been ‘airdropping’ tokens in the wallets of users. This is done to either spread the distribution of tokens, or to advertise the token to users.</p>
<p>The amount of airdropped tokens you receive depends (in a lot of airdrops) on how much Ethereum you had at a specified block. Some airdrops drop the same amount of tokens to everyone.</p>
<p>That said, your Ethereum address is public on the blockchain, which means that anyone is able to send you ETH and/or tokens. If you want to find more information about airdropped tokens you received in your wallet, you can look them up on the internet for more information.</p>

<li>The Ethereum blockchain is not owned by a centralized entityu, but is verified and maintained by thousands of remote people called ‘miners’ who use their time and energy to keep it all in check.</li>
<li>This is why our site, and sites like <a href="https://etherscan.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan</a> and <a href="https://ethplorer.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethplorer</a>, are able to pull your wallet information.

<p>It is not recommended to unlock your wallet every time you’d like to check your balance, for the security of your information. Instead, you can see all balances and transaction history through the use of an Ethereum blockchain explorer, like <a href="https://etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan</a> or <a href="https://ethplorer.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethplorer</a>. To check your balance, all you need is your public Ethereum address. This is 42 characters long and begins with an ‘0x….’.</p>
<p>Be aware that when checking ETC balances, you should use an Ethereum Classic blockchain explorer instead, such as Gastracker.io.</p>
<h2 id="Etherscan"><a href="#Etherscan" class="headerlink" title="Etherscan"></a><strong>Etherscan</strong></h2><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Head to <a href="https://etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan.io</a>. </p>

<p>Any ERC20 token can be added to your local MEW interface by following these instructions.</p>
<h2 id="Make-sure-it-isn’t-already-a-default-token"><a href="#Make-sure-it-isn’t-already-a-default-token" class="headerlink" title="Make sure it isn’t already a default token"></a><strong>Make sure it isn’t already a default token</strong></h2><p>First you’ll want to make sure your token isn’t already listed in our interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> <a href>Access your wallet</a>. </p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom1.png" width="85%"></p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Search our default token list for the token you are looking for.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you see the token, but don’t see a balance, it’s possible our default listing is for a token with the same symbol but a different contract address. In this case, continue with these steps as if you didn’t see it in the list.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> If you don’t see your token, continue with this article.</p>
<h2 id="Looking-for-the-token’s-information"><a href="#Looking-for-the-token’s-information" class="headerlink" title="Looking for the token’s information"></a><strong>Looking for the token’s information</strong></h2><p>You will need three pieces of information to add a custom token with our interface: the contract address, decimal count, and symbol. All of this information can be found via an Ethereum blockchain explorer, like Etherscan.io or Ethplorer.io. We will show how to find this via Etherscan.io.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Head to <a href="https://etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan</a>. </p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom2.png" width="85%"></p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> If you have a balance of the token you are trying to add, search for your public address (0x…) in the search bar. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you do not have a balance and would like to add the token before receiving it, search for the token in the search bar. Make sure you find the correct token, or you will be adding another token to your list.</li>
<li>There is no harm in sending your ERC20 token to your address before adding it as a custom token. In fact, this may make it easier to find via etherscan.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom3.png" width="60%"></p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Find your token in the token balances dropdown. Select the token to be taken to a token information screen. </p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom4.png" width="85%"></p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Here, you will find the token’s contract address and decimal count to the right of the interface. Remember the decimal count, and click on the contract address to be taken to the token’s main screen.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom5.png" width="70%"></p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Copy this address to your clipboard, and head back to MEW. At the top of the token list, click ‘+ Custom Tokens’ to bring up the custom token addition screen. </p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom6.png" width="50%"></p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Paste the contract address into the top field, input the token’s symbol (abbreviation) into the second field, and enter the decimal count last. Then click ‘Save’. You’re done!</p>
<h2 id="Common-Issues"><a href="#Common-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Common Issues"></a><strong>Common Issues</strong></h2><h4 id="“Token-Already-Exists-”"><a href="#“Token-Already-Exists-”" class="headerlink" title="“Token Already Exists!”"></a><em>“Token Already Exists!”</em></h4><p><img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom7.png" width="50%"></p>
<p>If you see this error, there is a simple fix for it. Re-enter your custom token information, but put a ‘2’ after the symbol. I.e. If the token’s symbol is ‘XYZ’, enter is as ‘XYZ2’.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/tokens/Custom8.png" width="50%"></p>
<p>If you still get this error after submitting it with the modified symbol, then your token is likely already a default token. Try searching the token list again for the symbol. If you see it with a balance of 0, but etherscan.io shows a balance, then you’ll likely need to change networks to another ETH node, in the upper right-hand corner. </p>
<h2 id="My-custom-tokens-are-disappearing"><a href="#My-custom-tokens-are-disappearing" class="headerlink" title="My custom tokens are disappearing!"></a><strong>My custom tokens are disappearing!</strong></h2><p>If your custom tokens are disappearing every time you access our interface, make sure that you do not have a cache-clearing software installed (i.e. CCleaner). Your custom token information is stored locally in your browser, so this software will clear this information and require you to re-submit the token every time you access your wallet. </p>

<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Access your wallet and head to the ‘Contracts’ section, to the left of your wallet interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> There should be a Must Multisig Contract ABI in the dropdown. If not, we have provided the ABI at the bottom of this article, which you can manually input into the interface. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Enter your contract address in the ‘Contract Address’ field at the top. </p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Select ‘Execute’ from the dropdown menu. </p>
<ul>
<li>Enter the address you want to send to in the <code>_To</code> field.</li>
<li>Enter the amount you want to send in the <code>_Value</code> field. </li>
<li>Leave the <code>Data</code> field empty. </li>
<li>We suggest sending a small amount first, to test the waters.</li>
<li>Unlock the owner’s address, and click <code>Write</code>.</li>
<li>A pop-up will appear. Leave the <code>Amount to Send</code> as <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>Click ‘Generate Transaction’, confirm the transaction, and send. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Click the Transaction ID that outputs with the ‘Success’ message. Copy this ID.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> If it’s a multisig contract with two owners, you will need to refresh this page and choose ‘Confirm’.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Step 5, you opened the Transaction ID from the ‘Execute’ call. You should have a page like <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0c643a1ae66637217f24791df05071c7849941a1231cf9fa2a0daf145da833e3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> open.</li>
<li>Click the ‘Event Logs’ tab.</li>
<li>For reference, at <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x47e4cc8748e296d9b5d85ebd9bd705177bb1940517b084a2efcca11feeb2391d#eventlog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> link (note this is not YOUR link, it’s an example), the <code>_h</code> value would be <code>9228aeaf3ed560274899483646ea4ce9b322bccffac60cac2d035d08752617f4</code>.</li>
<li>Check the link above where it says that string, and then compare it to find what YOUR <code>_h</code> value is. It will be different than what we provided as an example. </li>
<li>Go back to MEW, where you have the ‘Confirm’ page open, and paste your string into the <code>_h</code> field.</li>
<li>Click ‘Write’ again and unlock the second owner’s account. </li>
<li>Generate and send the transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> Double-check to confirm everything went as intended.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8.</strong> If your multisig is a 3 of 5 multisig, you will repeat the confirm process outlined in Step 6 until it reaches the necessary approvals. Luckily, the <code>_h</code> value will remain the same for each of them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9.</strong> You can view another approval for our previous example <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x47e4cc8748e296d9b5d85ebd9bd705177bb1940517b084a2efcca11feeb2391d#eventlog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10.</strong> Feel free to repeat this process whenever you want to send ETH. </p>

<p><strong>1. Install <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etheraddresslookup/pdknmigbbbhmllnmgdfalmedcmcefdfn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EAL</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/phishfort-protect/bdiohckpogchppdldbckcdjlklanhkfc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PhishFort</a>, or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cryptonite-by-metacert/keghdcpemohlojlglbiegihkljkgnige" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cryptonite</a>.</strong> These Chrome Extensions warn you when visiting malicious sites.<br><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>2. Never click a link sent to you, even if it looks like it was sent by a legitimate crypto company.</strong> Search for the service on Google, and find the information there. (Make sure it’s not an ad!)</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/security/ProTip1.jpg" width=" 65%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>3. You will never have to enter your private key for any service, airdrop, or KYC verification.</strong> Do not give your private key to anyone!<br><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>4. Check the URL very closely, to make sure it’s the one you are expecting.</strong> Phishers are very clever with their tiny dots and accents. Bookmark all the sites you frequent most!</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/security/ProTip2.jpg" width=" 65%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>5. Always Google search any token sales or ICOs you’re interested in.</strong> If it’s a scam, others will likely be posting about it. Check their Twitter, Reddit, etc. (Follow us on Twitter and Reddit while you’re at it!)</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/security/ProTip3.jpg" width=" 65%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>6. Search smart, and look for common signs of scams – lack of followers in common, angry comments, etc.</strong> Remember, there are many fake bots and accounts out there!</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/security/ProTip4.jpg" width=" 65%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>7. Before sending crypto to any address, search it on Etherscan first.</strong> There is a comment section there that is likely to be full of angry people if the address is known for stealing funds.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/security/ProTip5.jpg" width=" 65%"><br><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>8. Double and triple-check everything!</strong> Make sure every address is 100% correct, as even one wrong character will lead to a completely different wallet. We cannot reverse or refund transactions, so this is very important!<br><br><br><br></p>
<p><strong>9. Make sure the URL at the top of your interface shows that you are on our correct site, MyEtherWallet.com.</strong> Be cautious of any tiny dots or accents over the letters. Seeing these means you’re on a fake site.<br><br><br><br></p>

<p>Lately, a lot of blockchain projects on Ethereum have been ‘airdropping’ tokens in the wallets of users. This is done to either spread the distribution of tokens, or to advertise the token to users.</p>
<p>The amount of airdropped tokens you receive depends (in a lot of airdrops) on how much Ethereum you had at a specified block. Some airdrops drop the same amount of tokens to everyone.</p>
<p>That said, your Ethereum address is public on the blockchain, which means that anyone is able to send you ETH and/or tokens. If you want to find more information about airdropped tokens you received in your wallet, you can look them up on the internet for more information.</p>

<p>ICO stands for ‘Initial Coin Offering’, also known as a ‘token sale’ or ‘crowdsale’. It is an unregulated fundraising method for startups. Start-up companies use these funds to further develop and complete their blockchain based software projects. It is similar to an IPO (Initial Public Offering), in which investors purchase shares of a company.</p>
<p>ICOs offer ‘tokens’ in return for users who support them by sending them ETH. When you give these ICO teams your ETH/BTC or other currencies, it means that you believe the technologies they are creating will bring value to the Ethereum community.</p>
<p>In the beginning of an ICO, the leading team will explain their vision and will normally provide a ‘white paper’. This white paper contains a lot of valuable information that you should read, even if you do not understand a lot of the technical terms. As long as you get a basic understanding of what the token is about, it will help in your decision making.</p>
<p>Take note of the team and web developers behind the ICO. Reputable programmers and business people usually mean that the ICO is legitimate, and that it has a lot of potential. Sometimes, these teams recruit well known Facebook developers or managers/Google employees, this is when you know that the token team is truly creating something valuable.</p>
<p>It is crucial to do your research on an ICO that you are interested in. ICO hype in the community has caused many people and fake companies to create ‘scam’ ICOs, simply because it is easy to raise money due to the hype created around the token. Scam ICOs usually execute the ‘pump and dump’ method for gaining maximum profits. Creating hype around a token is fairly easy to do, and you should try your best not to let FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) cloud your judgement. Hype can easily be created through posts on Reddit/Facebook/Slack/etc by people who are looking to make a quick buck with the pump and dump method.</p>
<p><strong>Pump and dump:</strong> When a token is full of hype and no backbone or actual real world value, a lot of people will ride the hype wave up. Everyone will see that the token is performing exceptionally well on exchanges and buy in, but there are also people who are ready to dump massive amounts of the token back into the exchanges (hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of the token, sometimes millions of dollars worth). Selling massive amounts of tokens back into the market causes the price to plummet, and then everyone else starts to panic and sell off to cut of loses.</p>
<p>The value of tokens/ETH/BTC/etc is all driven by the market. You have the ability to make the price go up or down. It follows the ‘supply and demand’ economic concept. If there are more people who want a token, but there is a limited supply of the token, the price increases. If no one wants the token, there is a surge of supply avaiable on the market, then the price decreases.</p>
<p>There are many successful and truly valuable technologies and concepts that have come out of ICOs, and that is a good thing. But you must always remain vigilant and do a lot of research before investing in anything.</p>

<h2 id="Longer-answer"><a href="#Longer-answer" class="headerlink" title="Longer answer:"></a><strong>Longer answer:</strong></h2><p>Your funds and information are not ‘in’ MyEtherWallet (MEW). Your wallet exists on the blockchain itself, and MEW just offers a way for anyone to interact with the blockchain easily. If MEW went down, you would simply have to find another Ethereum blockchain interface that would allow you to access your wallet. </p>
<p>The information used to unlock your MEW wallet is the same information that can be used to unlock your wallet on another platform. We always suggest doing research before entering your information into an unfamiliar site.</p>
<p>You can import your unencrypted private key and your Geth/Mist Format (encrypted) files directly into geth / Ethereum Wallet / Mist very easily.</p>
<p>You can also <a href>run MyEtherWallet locally</a> and/or <a href>connect it to your own node</a>.</p>
